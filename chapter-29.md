# Chapter 29: Starting Over

The coffee shop on Elm Street was new—or at least new since I'd gone away. Modern and bright, nothing like the greasy diner on Main Street where crews used to hang out.

Amy was already there when I arrived, sitting at a corner table with two coffees waiting. She'd gotten me black, no sugar. Remembered from library breaks months ago.

"Thanks," I said, sliding into the seat across from her.

"How'd the probation check-in go?"

"Fine. Standard questions. Where I'm living, what I'm doing for work, any contact with former associates." I wrapped my hands around the warm mug. "Officer Rodriguez seems okay. Stricter than Garrett but fair."

"That's good."

We sat in comfortable silence for a moment, both of us adjusting to being here together outside the library, outside the structure of tutoring sessions or crisis conversations.

Just two people having coffee.

"So," Amy said. "Tell me about education. You said you're studying to be a teacher?"

She lit up. "Yeah. Elementary ed with a focus on literacy. I'm taking child development, educational psychology, foundations of teaching." She laughed. "It's a lot of theory right now, but next year I can start doing classroom observations."

"You'll be great at it." I meant it. "You were patient with me when I was being stubborn about algebra. Elementary kids can't be worse than that."

"You weren't that bad. Just... determined to do things your own way."

"Stubborn," I corrected. "You can say it."

She smiled. "Okay. Stubborn. But you learned once you trusted the process."

The word 'trust' hung between us, heavier than she'd probably meant it.

"I've been thinking a lot about trust," I said. "These past six months. About how I spent my whole life not trusting anyone, and how that almost destroyed everything that mattered."

"And now?"

"Now I'm trying to learn. It's not easy—I still catch myself wanting to handle things alone, make decisions without asking for help. But I'm working on it." I met her eyes. "You were right, back before everything went wrong. I was protecting myself from vulnerability by shutting you out. I'm trying not to do that anymore."

Amy reached across the table, touched my hand. "That takes courage. Real courage, not the fake kind that's just bravado."

"Doesn't always feel courageous. Sometimes it just feels terrifying."

"That's how you know it's real." She pulled her hand back, wrapped it around her own mug. "I've been working on stuff too. Setting boundaries with my mom. Figuring out who I am separate from everyone's expectations."

"How's that going?"

"Hard." She laughed ruefully. "Mom's still not happy about us. She made it very clear over Christmas that she thinks I'm throwing my life away caring about someone with a criminal record. We had a huge fight about it."

Guilt twisted in my gut. "I'm sorry. I never wanted to come between you and your family."

"You're not. My mother's expectations and my choices are coming between us. That's different." Amy's voice was firm. "I love my mom. But I'm an adult now. I get to decide who matters to me."

"And I matter?"

"Of course you matter." She said it like it was obvious. "Marcus, you think six months changed how I feel about you? Made me forget who you are?"

"I hoped it didn't. But I worried—" I stopped, choosing words carefully. "You have this whole new life now. New friends, new experiences. College is supposed to be about finding yourself, trying new things. I didn't want to be the high school mistake holding you back."

Amy set down her mug with enough force to make it clink. "Is that what you think you are? A mistake?"

"I think I'm a guy on probation who can't give you the normal college boyfriend experience. Can't take you to parties or campus events because of my curfew. Can't be introduced to your friends without them googling my name and finding my arrest record." The words came out more bitter than I intended. "I'm baggage, Amy. You deserve someone without all that weight."

"Stop." Her voice was sharp enough to make me look up. "Stop deciding what I deserve. That's the same thing you did before—making choices for me because you think you know better."

"That's not what I'm—"

"It is." She leaned forward. "You're sitting here telling me I deserve someone better instead of asking me what I want. That's you deciding again, Marcus. That's you not trusting me to know my own mind."

The truth in her words hit hard.

"You're right," I admitted. "Sorry. Old habits."

"I know." Her voice softened. "But we're supposed to be working on that, remember? Trusting each other. Being honest about what we want instead of assuming."

"Okay." I took a breath. "What do you want, Amy? With us. With this."

She was quiet for a moment, thinking.

"I want to try," she said finally. "Really try. Not dating in secret, not hiding from my mother's disapproval, not pretending it's easy. I want to see if we can build something real together—you and me as we are now, not who we were before."

"Even with my probation restrictions? My record?"

"Yes. Even with that." She held my gaze. "I'm not naive, Marcus. I know there will be challenges. That some people will judge me for being with you. That your parole officer might have opinions about us seeing each other. But I also know that the person I got to know in that library was worth caring about. And I don't think six months in county jail changed that."

"It did change me though," I said quietly. "Prison—even county jail—it gets inside you. I came out different than I went in."

"How?"

I thought about it. "Quieter. More careful. I spent six months watching everything I said and did, staying out of trouble, keeping my head down. It's hard to just... relax now. Let my guard down."

"Even with me?"

"Especially with you." I looked down at my hands. "You're the one thing I can't afford to screw up again. It makes me want to be perfect, which makes me tense, which makes everything harder."

Amy was quiet for a moment. Then she said, "What if we made a deal?"

"What kind of deal?"

"Neither of us gets to be perfect. We're both going to mess up, say the wrong thing, make mistakes. But we promise to be honest about it when it happens. To talk instead of shutting down. To trust each other enough to be imperfect."

The idea was both terrifying and relieving.

"I can try that," I said.

"Good. Me too." She smiled. "So let's practice. I'll go first. I'm scared that you'll decide I'm not worth the trouble. That my family's disapproval or the restrictions you face will make you walk away because you think it's better for me."

Her honesty made my chest tight. "I'm scared you'll wake up one day and realize you could have someone easier. Someone without all my mess. And you'll regret wasting time on me."

"See?" Amy said gently. "We're both scared of the same thing—losing each other. So maybe instead of running from that fear, we face it together."

"Together," I echoed. The word felt less scary than it used to.

"Marcus." She reached across the table again, took my hand. "Before we go any further, I need to know something. Do you still feel the same way you did before? Because six months is a long time. People change. And if you've changed your mind about us, I need to know now."

I looked at our hands joined on the table—her fingers small and pale against mine, callused from six months of work detail.

"I love you more now than I did before," I said. Voice rough but honest. "Because I know what I almost lost. Because six months apart showed me how much you matter. Because every letter you wrote reminded me there was something worth coming back to." I met her eyes. "If anything, being away made me more sure, not less."

Amy's eyes went bright with tears. "Really?"

"Really. I love you, Amy Parker. I'm probably going to screw up and say the wrong thing and make mistakes. But that part—how I feel about you—that's not changing."

"I love you too." The words came out soft but certain. "I missed you every single day. Wrote you letters even when you couldn't write back. Thought about you constantly. And now you're here and I just want to..." She trailed off, laughing at herself. "Sorry. I'm being dramatic."

"No." I squeezed her hand. "You're being honest. That's what we promised, right? Honesty."

"Right." She wiped her eyes with her free hand. "Okay. Honesty. I want to kiss you. I've wanted to since yesterday in the library but didn't know if we were there yet."

Heat flooded my face. "Oh."

"Is that okay? Or too fast? We can slow down if—"

I leaned across the table and kissed her.

It was brief, clumsy, over too fast. But her lips were soft and warm and when I pulled back she was smiling.

"Hi," she said.

"Hi." I couldn't stop smiling either.

"So," Amy said, still holding my hand. "We're doing this. For real."

"For real," I agreed. "No secrets. No shutting each other out. No protecting each other by making decisions alone."

"And if it gets hard?"

"We talk about it. Figure it out together." I paused. "I'm going to mess up. Probably a lot at first."

"Me too. But we'll learn." She stood up, tugged my hand. "Come on. Let's walk."

We left the coffee shop hand in hand, walking down Elm Street toward the park. It was cold and gray, typical February weather, but it felt like spring.

Like starting over.

Like maybe—finally—I was learning to trust someone enough to build a future with them instead of protecting them from myself.

It wouldn't be easy. I still had probation to finish, a record to live with, demons to face.

But I wasn't facing them alone anymore.

And that made all the difference.

# Chapter 19: Her Choice

Amy sat across from me at the study room table, hands folded in front of her, thinking. I watched her work through the problem the same way she worked through algebra—methodical, looking for the solution hidden in the variables.

I didn't have her optimism. I'd spent the last five days looking for solutions and found nothing but dead ends.

"Okay," she said finally. "Talk to Officer Garrett. Tell him about Snake's threats."

I almost laughed. "And say what? That a guy I used to run with said some things that scared me? It's my word against his, Amy."

"Then at least it's on record."

"Garrett already thinks I'm one mistake from prison. He won't help."

"You don't know that."

"Yeah, I do." I kept my voice flat. "I've lived this my whole life, Amy. The system isn't designed to help guys like me. It's designed to catch us when we fall."

She was quiet for a moment, and I thought maybe she was finally understanding how impossible this was.

Then she said, "But you haven't fallen yet."

"What?"

"You haven't done anything wrong. Snake threatened you, but you haven't committed a crime. You haven't violated probation." She leaned forward. "If you go to Garrett now, before anything happens, you're showing you want to stay clean. That has to count for something."

"Or it makes me look weak. Makes me a target." I rubbed my face, exhausted. "And even if he believes me, he can't do anything about threats until Snake commits a crime. By then it's too late."

"So you're just going to give up? Accept that Snake has you trapped?"

"I'm being realistic."

"You're being defeatist." Her voice had an edge. "There's a difference."

Amy pressed forward. "What happens if you do Snake's job? You show up tonight, help him. Then what?"

"Then he leaves me alone."

"Will he?" She held my gaze. "Or will there be another job next month, and another one after that? Every time threatening someone you care about to make you comply?"

I wanted to argue but couldn't. Because she was right.

"If you do this job you're showing Snake he can control you," Amy continued. "You'll never be free of him."

"And if I don't, he destroys your reputation." My voice was rough. "Ruins your college prospects."

"Maybe he's bluffing. Maybe he doesn't have the power to do all that and he's counting on you being too scared to call him on it."

"It's not a risk I'm willing to take."

"Why not?"

"Because it's your future, Amy! Your whole life!"

"But you're willing to gamble with yours?"

The question stopped me cold.

"That's different," I said finally.

"How?"

"Because my future is already—" I gestured vaguely. "It's already damaged. But you have real options. I'm not destroying that."

Amy was quiet for a long moment. When she spoke her voice was softer but determined.

"You really believe your future doesn't matter as much as mine?"

"I believe your future is worth protecting."

"So is yours." She reached across the table. "You've been working so hard these past months. Don't you think that matters?"

"Not compared to what you're building."

"Stop it." The sharpness was back. "Stop ranking our worth like you're somehow less important. You matter, Marcus. And I'm not going to watch you throw it away because you've decided I'm worth more than you are."

"I'm trying to protect you."

"I don't need protection!" Her voice rose. "I need you to trust me."

"This isn't about—"

"Yes, it is." She cut me off. "You're so convinced you don't deserve good things that you'll sacrifice yourself without even considering there might be another way."

The words cut deep because they were true.

I looked away, jaw tight.

"What if there isn't another way?" I asked quietly.

"Then we figure it out together. Not with you making the decision alone." She waited until I looked at her. "I get to have a say in decisions that affect my life."

"Your choice would be to let Snake hurt you?"

"My choice would be to not let fear control my life." Her voice was steady. "Go to Officer Garrett. Tell him what Snake threatened. Get it on record."

"Garrett won't care."

"You don't know that."

"Amy—"

"You're assuming based on what you think will happen. But you haven't actually tried. Giving up before you even try is guaranteeing failure."

I wanted to argue but I was so tired. Tired of fighting this alone.

"What if I go to Garrett and he doesn't help?" My voice came out small. "What if Snake retaliates anyway?"

"Then at least you tried. At least you didn't just roll over and let him control you."

"And you're okay with that risk?"

"No," she said honestly. "I'm scared. But I'm more scared of watching you give up on yourself."

She paused, then added quietly, "I care about you too much to let that happen without a fight."

The words hung in the air between us.

I stared at her. "What?"

"I care about you." She said it clearly, meeting my eyes without flinching. "I know I'm not supposed to. I know my mother would have a fit if she knew. I know this whole town would have opinions. But I do. And you don't get to decide I stop caring just because things got complicated."

My throat was tight. "Amy—"

"I'll go with you to talk to Garrett if you want. We can explain together what Snake threatened. Or I'll wait here if you want to go alone. But I'm not walking away from this. From you." Her voice was fierce. "So stop trying to make me."

I couldn't speak. Couldn't process what she was saying—that she cared about me, that she was willing to stand with me, that she wasn't running even though she should.

Part of me wanted to tell her she was crazy. That caring about me would only bring her pain. That she should walk away while she still could.

But a bigger part—the part that had been drowning in isolation and fear—desperately wanted to believe her.

"I don't know how to do this," I admitted finally. Voice rough, honest. "How to let someone help. How to trust that it won't all fall apart anyway."

"Neither do I," Amy said. "But we can figure it out together. If you let me."

I looked at her sitting there across from me—determined and scared and so much braver than I'd given her credit for. She wasn't the perfect good girl I'd tried to protect. She was real and complicated and strong enough to make her own choices.

Even if that choice was standing beside a guy who'd only bring her trouble.

"I want to tell you to walk away," I said quietly. "To leave before my past drags you down."

"But?"

"But I don't want to be alone anymore." The admission hurt coming out. "And I don't—I don't know if I can do this without you."

Amy's expression softened. "Then don't. Let me help."

"If this goes wrong—"

"We'll deal with it." She said it like a promise. "Together. Okay?"

I wanted to say I love you. The words were right there, pushing at my throat, desperate to be spoken.

But I couldn't. Not yet. Not when everything was so uncertain and I still didn't believe I deserved her faith in me.

So instead I just nodded.

"Okay," I said. Voice barely above a whisper. "I'll think about talking to Garrett."

"Not think about it. Do it." Her voice was gentle but firm. "Today. Before tonight's deadline. Promise me."

I looked at her and saw she wasn't going to back down. Wasn't going to let me deflect or delay or protect her by lying.

"I promise," I said.

Amy smiled, small and relieved. "Good. Then let's figure out exactly what you're going to say."

She pulled out a piece of paper and a pen like we were studying for a test instead of trying to keep my life from falling apart. Started writing down points, organizing thoughts the way she organized everything—methodically, carefully, with the kind of focus I'd come to recognize over our months of tutoring sessions.

"Tell Garrett everything," she said, writing. "When Snake approached you, what he threatened, the deadline. Be specific about dates and times. That makes it real, harder to dismiss."

I watched her work, this good girl from the right side of town planning how to help a guy like me fight back against his past. She should be running. Should be protecting herself and her perfect future.

Instead she was here, fighting for me when I'd given up on fighting for myself.

"Amy," I said quietly.

She looked up.

"Thank you."

Her expression softened. "You don't have to thank me for caring about you, Marcus. That's not something you have to earn."

But that was the thing—I'd spent my whole life believing love and help and second chances were things you had to earn. Things guys like me never deserved in the first place.

Amy was showing me something different. That maybe some people helped because they wanted to, not because you'd proved yourself worthy.

Despite everything—the fear and the uncertainty and Snake's deadline looming—I felt something unfamiliar uncoil in my chest.

Hope.

Maybe she was right. Maybe I didn't have to do this alone.

Maybe trust was a choice I could make, even when it scared me.

"Okay," I said, pulling my chair closer to see what she was writing. "What do I say first?"

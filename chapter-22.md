# Chapter 22: The Job Goes Wrong

I sat in my truck outside the house for twenty minutes, engine off, hands still shaking on the steering wheel. The porch light was off—Mom was still at the cannery working her overnight shift. The whole street was dark and quiet, normal people sleeping through a normal Saturday night.

Like I hadn't just thrown away everything that mattered.

Inside the house felt too quiet. I stood in the dark living room, not turning on lights, just staring at nothing.

My phone buzzed. Text from Snake: *Lose your phone. Cops might trace it. Dump it tonight.*

I stared at the message, then threw the phone against the wall. It didn't break—just bounced off and skittered across the floor, screen still glowing with Snake's instructions.

He'd planned this. Had known there was security, had known it might go wrong, and he'd brought me anyway. Used me as another body, another guy to take the fall if things went sideways.

And I'd let him.

I'd known better. Had known Snake didn't care about me, that the crew was never really family. But I'd shown up anyway because I was too scared of losing Amy to see I was walking into a trap.

The crew had used me. And I'd let them because I'd been trying to protect someone the wrong way—by lying, by hiding, by making bad choices alone instead of trusting the people who actually cared.

Amy had told me to talk to Garrett. To get the threats on record. To break the cycle instead of giving Snake what he wanted.

I'd tried talking to Garrett. It hadn't worked.

But I hadn't told Amy. Hadn't gone back and said "it failed, what do we do now?" Hadn't trusted her enough to work through it together.

I'd just given up and done exactly what Snake wanted.

And now I'd destroyed my future anyway—the thing I'd been trying to save by protecting Amy.

I sank onto the couch, head in my hands.

Security footage would show my face. The guard had seen all of us. Even if Snake got away, even if Rico and J.T. kept their mouths shut, the evidence would lead back to me. Marcus Webb, on probation, caught on camera breaking into a warehouse.

Garrett would have no choice. Probation violated. Adult prison.

Everything I'd worked for these past months—the GED studying, the library work, trying to prove I was more than my past—gone in one night.

I thought about Amy. About her patient smile when I finally understood a difficult concept. About how she looked at me like I was worth something. About her saying "you don't have to earn my caring about you."

I thought about Mr. Donovan treating me with respect I didn't deserve. About my mom's fragile hope when I'd told her I was getting my GED.

All of it destroyed because I'd been too scared to trust anyone, too convinced I had to protect everyone by myself.

The irony was brutal. I'd done this to protect Amy's reputation. But getting arrested for burglary was going to hurt her reputation worse than any photos Snake could have spread. The whole town would know she'd been spending time with a criminal. Would judge her for caring about me. Would prove her mother right about guys like me.

I'd made everything worse trying to make it better.

The night dragged on. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, couldn't think past the sick certainty that Sunday morning would bring police to my door.

Around four a.m. I heard Mom's car pull into the driveway. I stayed on the couch, lights still off, waiting.

She came in exhausted, setting her purse on the kitchen counter, pulling off her shoes. Saw me sitting in the dark.

"Marcus?" She flipped on a lamp. "Baby, what are you doing up? It's four in the morning."

I looked at her—worn down by double shifts, tired from years of struggling alone, still holding onto hope that her youngest son might turn out different than his brother.

"I messed up, Mom."

Her expression shifted, worry replacing exhaustion. She sat down next to me on the couch. "What happened?"

So I told her. Everything. Snake's threats, Garrett's useless advice, the choice that wasn't really a choice, showing up at the depot, the warehouse, the alarm, running.

Mom listened without interrupting. When I finished she was quiet for a long time.

"Are you hurt?" she finally asked.

"No."

"Did you hurt anyone else?"

"No. The guard—he called the cops but nobody touched him. We just ran."

"Good." She touched my shoulder, squeezed gently. "That's good."

"Mom, I violated probation. I'm going to prison."

"Maybe."

"Garrett was clear. Any criminal activity and I'm done."

"Then we deal with it." Her voice was steady, tired but steady. "But sitting here hating yourself doesn't help anything."

"I should have—" The words stuck. Should have what? Trusted Amy? Refused Snake no matter the consequences? Never joined the crew in the first place?

"Should've doesn't matter now," Mom said. "What matters is what you do next."

"What can I do? The cops are probably already looking for me."

"So you go to them first." She said it like it was obvious. "You turn yourself in. You tell them what happened—about Snake threatening you, pressuring you. It won't make the charges go away but it's better than running."

"They won't believe me."

"Maybe not. But at least you're taking responsibility instead of hiding." She squeezed my shoulder again. "You can't run from this, baby. You can't fix it by lying or hiding or making more bad choices. You have to face it head-on."

I wanted to argue. Wanted to say facing it would just make it worse, that the system didn't care about guys like me, that taking responsibility was pointless when I was going to prison either way.

But looking at Mom—exhausted and worried but still here, still trying to help—I knew she was right.

Running never protected anyone. I'd learned that lesson too late.

"Okay," I said quietly. "Tomorrow. I'll go tomorrow."

"Today," she corrected. "It's already Sunday morning. Let the cops come if they're coming. But you don't make them chase you. Understand?"

I nodded.

Mom stood up, touched my hair like she used to when I was little. "Get some sleep if you can. Whatever happens next, you're going to need your strength."

She went to her room, leaving me alone in the living room with the lamp casting long shadows across Danny's high school photo on the wall.

My brother had made bad choices and ended up in county jail. Now I was following the same path.

But at least I could stop running. Stop lying. Stop trying to protect everyone by destroying myself.

At least I could face the consequences like Mom said—head-on, taking responsibility, not hiding.

It wouldn't save me. But maybe it would prove I'd actually learned something from all this.

Maybe it would prove that trying to change had meant something, even if I'd failed.

I curled up on the couch and waited for morning.

Waited for the police.

Waited for everything to fall apart.

---

Sunday morning came with bright California sunshine that felt wrong for the end of the world.

I sat at the kitchen table drinking coffee I couldn't taste, watching the clock tick toward eight a.m.

Mom made breakfast neither of us ate. We sat in silence, waiting.

At eight-thirty someone knocked on the front door.

My stomach dropped.

Mom looked at me. I nodded.

She opened the door.

Officer Garrett stood on the porch, alone this time. No handcuffs out, but his expression said everything.

"Mrs. Webb," he said. "I need to speak with Marcus."

"He's right here." Mom stepped aside.

I stood up from the table and walked to the door.

Garrett's expression was disappointed but not surprised. Like he'd known all along this was how my story would end.

"Marcus," he said. "The Riverside PD contacted me this morning about a break-in last night at Chen Electronics on Industrial Boulevard. Security cameras caught four individuals entering the building. The footage is clear enough to identify faces."

I didn't say anything. Couldn't.

"One of those faces is yours," Garrett continued. "The owner is pressing charges. Burglary, criminal trespass, vandalism. And for you, probation violation."

Mom made a small sound behind me.

"You have forty-eight hours to turn yourself in to the Riverside Police Department," Garrett said. "If you don't, they'll issue a warrant and come get you. Either way, this is a probation violation. You understand what that means?"

"Adult prison," I said quietly.

"Yeah." He looked almost sorry about it. "I warned you, Marcus. I told you what would happen if you participated in criminal activity."

"I know."

"So why'd you do it?"

I met his eyes. "Because I was stupid. Because I thought I could protect someone by making bad choices. I was wrong."

Garrett studied me for a moment. "Forty-eight hours. Monday morning, nine a.m., turn yourself in at the station. Don't make them hunt you down."

He left.

I stood in the doorway watching his car pull away, feeling the weight of the next forty-eight hours crushing down.

Two days of freedom left. Two days before I officially destroyed everything.

Mom closed the door and we stood there in silence.

My phone buzzed. I pulled it out—Amy calling.

I stared at her name on the screen and couldn't answer. Couldn't face telling her what I'd done. How I'd thrown away everything she'd believed in.

The call went to voicemail.

She called again five minutes later.

I still didn't answer.

"Marcus," Mom said softly. "Sit down. Tell me everything."

So I did.

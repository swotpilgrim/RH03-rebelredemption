# Chapter 25: Her Anger, His Truth

Back in Donovan's office, Amy sat in the chair I'd vacated while I stood by the window. I couldn't sit still, couldn't stop moving. Two hours until I had to turn myself in.

Donovan looked between us. "You both need to understand what Marcus is facing. Burglary, criminal trespass, vandalism, and probation violation. These are serious charges."

"I know," I said.

"Do you?" Donovan's voice was gentle but firm. "Because this isn't county jail like your brother, Marcus. Adult prison. State facility. Years, not months."

The words hit like punches. I'd known it intellectually, but hearing Donovan say it made it real in a way it hadn't been before.

"How many years?" Amy asked quietly.

"That depends on the prosecutor, the judge, whether there's a plea deal." Donovan folded his hands on his desk. "But we're likely looking at a minimum of two to three years. Could be more."

Two to three years. I'd be twenty-one when I got out. Everything—the library, the GED, the life I'd been trying to build—gone.

"There has to be something," Amy said. "He was coerced. Snake threatened him, threatened me. That has to count for something."

"It might." Donovan looked at me. "If Marcus is willing to testify against the others involved. To cooperate with the investigation."

The crew code flashed through my mind: never snitch, loyalty above everything, snitches get stitches.

But what had crew loyalty ever gotten me except trapped?

"I'll testify," I said. "Against Snake, against all of them. I'll tell the cops everything."

Amy's expression flickered with something—relief? approval?—before settling back to guarded.

"That's a start," Donovan said. "You'll need a lawyer. Legal aid if your family can't afford private counsel. The lawyer can argue coercion, present your GED progress, my testimony about your work here. It won't erase the charges but it might influence sentencing."

"Okay," I said. Voice numb. "Okay."

"Mr. Donovan," Amy said. "Can I talk to Marcus alone for a minute?"

He nodded and stood. "I'll be at the front desk. You have until eight-forty-five, then we need to leave for the police station."

He left, closing the door behind him.

Amy stood and faced me, arms crossed. The softness from earlier was gone, replaced by something harder. Angrier.

"You're really going to do this," she said. "Turn yourself in. Go to prison."

"I don't have a choice."

"You had a choice Saturday night!" Her voice rose. "You had a choice when you decided to shut me out instead of trusting me to help figure out another way!"

"There wasn't another way. I tried—"

"You tried alone!" She stepped closer, eyes bright with anger and tears. "You talked to Garrett once, it didn't work, and you just gave up. Didn't come back to me. Didn't ask what we should do next. Just decided you knew best and went to that warehouse like a—like a—"

"Like an idiot," I finished. "I know."

"Do you?" Her voice cracked. "Do you really understand what you did? You threw away your future, Marcus. The GED you studied so hard for. The progress you made. The person you were becoming. All of it gone because you were too scared to trust me."

"I was trying to protect you!"

"No!" She jabbed a finger at my chest. "You were protecting yourself. From having to be vulnerable. From having to admit you needed help. From having to believe someone might actually care about you enough to fight for you!"

The words hit like she'd punched me.

"That's not—"

"Yes it is." Amy's voice shook. "I told you I cared about you. I begged you to let me help. And you looked me in the eye and lied. Made excuses. Shut me out completely. Do you know how that felt?"

I couldn't speak.

"It felt like you didn't trust me." Tears spilled down her cheeks. "Like after everything—all those sessions, all those conversations, all the times I told you I saw who you really were—you still didn't believe I meant it. Still thought I'd run the second things got hard."

"I didn't want you to have to choose," I said quietly. "Between me and your reputation. Your future."

"That wasn't your decision to make!" Her voice was fierce. "My reputation is mine. My future is mine. My choices are mine. And you don't get to decide what I can handle just because you think you're protecting me!"

She was right. About all of it.

"I'm sorry," I said. "You're right. I should have trusted you. Should have come back after Garrett and worked through it together. I was scared and I made everything worse and I'm so, so sorry."

Amy wiped her eyes angrily. "Sorry doesn't fix this."

"I know."

"Sorry doesn't give you back the years you're about to lose."

"I know."

"Sorry doesn't—" Her voice broke. She turned away, shoulders shaking.

I wanted to touch her, comfort her, but didn't know if I had the right anymore.

"What do you want from me?" I asked. Voice raw. "I can't undo Saturday night. Can't take back the choices I made. All I can do is face the consequences and hope—" I stopped.

"Hope what?"

"Hope that when I get out you might still—" The words stuck in my throat. "That you might still see something worth caring about."

Amy turned back, face wet with tears, expression caught between anger and something softer.

"Is that what you want?" she asked. "To come back and try again?"

"I don't have the right to want that."

"Answer the question, Marcus." Her eyes held mine. "What do you want? Not what you think you deserve. Not what you think is fair. What do you actually want?"

The truth came out before I could stop it.

"I want you," I said. "I want to come back and prove I learned from this. That I can be the person you thought I could be. That I can trust you and be honest and not screw everything up." My voice dropped. "I want a future with you in it, Amy. Even though I know I don't deserve it."

"And if I said you could have that?" Her voice was quiet, careful. "If I said I'd wait for you. That we could try again when you get out. Would you fight for it?"

I stared at her. "You're not serious."

"Answer the question."

"Of course I'd fight for it. I'd fight for you with everything I have." The words tumbled out desperate and honest. "But Amy, I'm looking at two to three years minimum. You'll be in college. You'll meet better guys, guys who don't have records and gang tattoos and futures full of parole check-ins. You shouldn't wait for me."

"Stop telling me what I should do!" Her anger flared again. "I'm so tired of you deciding what's best for me without asking! If I want to wait for you that's my choice. If I want to write to you in prison that's my choice. If I want to believe you can be better than your worst mistakes that's my choice!"

She stepped closer, close enough I could see every detail of her face—the tears, the anger, the stubborn determination that had drawn me to her in the first place.

"Do you love me?" she asked.

The question knocked the air from my lungs.

"What?"

"It's a simple question. Do you love me? Yes or no?"

I'd never said it out loud. Had barely let myself think it. Love was dangerous. Love was vulnerability. Love was everything I'd learned not to trust.

But looking at Amy—angry and hurt and still here, still fighting for me when she should run—I couldn't lie.

"Yes," I said hoarsely. "I love you. I'm in love with you. Have been for weeks. Maybe months. I don't even know when it happened but—yeah. I love you."

Amy's expression cracked, anger giving way to something raw and open.

"Then stop making decisions alone," she said. "Stop trying to protect me by shutting me out. Love means trusting me. It means being honest even when it's hard. It means letting me choose to stand with you instead of deciding I can't handle it."

Tears burned behind my eyes. "I don't know how to do that. How to trust like that."

"Then learn." Her voice softened. "You have time to learn, Marcus. Two, three years—that's a lot of time to figure out who you want to be. To work on trusting people. To grow up." She touched my face gently. "And when you get out, if you still want me, if you've done the work—we'll try. For real this time. With honesty and trust and no more protecting me from hard things."

I covered her hand with mine. "You really mean that? You'd wait?"

"I don't know." Her honesty cut but I appreciated it. "I need time to figure out how I feel. But I know I love you too, Marcus. And I know I'm not ready to walk away just because you made mistakes." She paused. "But you have to promise me something."

"Anything."

"Promise me you'll stop trying to be the person you think you should be and start being honest about who you are. No more hiding. No more deciding alone. When you get out, we do this together or not at all. Okay?"

"Okay," I whispered. "I promise."

She nodded. "Then let's go turn you in. Together."

"Together," I agreed.

Amy took my hand—the first time she'd touched me with anything other than anger since this all fell apart—and led me out of the office.

Mr. Donovan was waiting by the front desk. "Ready?"

No. I wasn't ready. Wasn't ready to give up my freedom, face prison, lose years of my life.

But I was ready to stop running. Ready to face consequences. Ready to start being honest about who I was and what I'd done.

"Yeah," I said. "I'm ready."

Amy's hand squeezed mine.

And we walked out together into the bright Monday morning.

# Chapter 8: Cracks in the Walls

Amy started arriving early to our sessions.

Just five minutes at first—showing up at 1:55 instead of two o'clock, settling at table three with her materials spread out before I finished my shelving shift. But then it became ten minutes, fifteen, and I found myself cutting my work short to meet her there, drawn by something I didn't want to examine too closely.

We'd sit in those stolen minutes before the official session started and talk. Not about GED prep or essays or reading comprehension. Just talk.

Books, mostly. She'd ask what I was reading. I'd tell her about finishing "White Fang" or starting "The Sea-Wolf." She'd recommend something new, explain why she loved it, listen when I shared what I'd connected with.

It felt dangerous, those conversations. Like we were becoming something more than tutor and student. Like we were becoming friends.

Or something I was too scared to name.

Tuesday afternoon, mid-July. The heat had settled over Riverside like a blanket, making even the library's cool air feel thick. I finished shelving at 1:50 and headed to table three to find Amy already there, fanning herself with a folder.

"It's miserable out there," she said by way of greeting.

I sat down, pulling my notebook from my back pocket. "Yeah. Truck's like an oven. Barely made it here without melting."

She smiled. "I don't know how you work in this heat. At least I get to sit in the air conditioning all day."

"You volunteer all day. That counts as work."

"I suppose." She pulled her materials closer. "Ready to tackle some writing?"

We'd been working on essay structure for two weeks—how to organize thoughts, build arguments, support claims with evidence. I'd never thought of writing as having rules before, just words you put on paper. But Amy showed me there was architecture to it, frameworks that made ideas stronger.

Today she slid a worksheet across the table. Practice prompts for the GED essay portion.

"Pick one and write a paragraph," she said. "We'll work on expanding it to a full essay."

I scanned the prompts. Describe a person who influenced you. Explain how technology has changed society. Discuss an obstacle you've overcome.

That last one caught my eye. Held it.

Obstacle you've overcome.

I picked up my pencil.

---

Twenty minutes later I set the pencil down. My hand ached and the page was covered in my rough handwriting—half print, half cursive, the way it came out when I wasn't thinking about it.

Amy looked up from the papers she'd been grading. "Done?"

"Yeah."

She reached for my paper. I almost pulled it back—what I'd written was too personal, too raw. But I let her take it.

She read in silence. I watched her face, trying to gauge her reaction, but her expression stayed neutral until she reached the end. Then something shifted—her eyes softened, her mouth tightened slightly like she was holding back words.

She set the paper down carefully.

"This is about your brother," she said quietly.

"Yeah." I stared at my hands. "That was the prompt. Obstacle overcome."

"Can I ask you about it?"

I shrugged, which we both knew meant yes.

"You wrote that watching your brother get sentenced made you question everything about the crew." Amy's voice was gentle, not pushing. "Is that what made you want to change?"

The question hung in the air between us. I could deflect. Could give her the easy answer about being scared of jail, about wanting to make my mom proud, about Judge Harrison giving me one last chance.

But Amy had just read what I'd written—about visiting Danny in county lockup, about seeing him behind reinforced glass in an orange jumpsuit, about realizing for the first time that the crew wasn't family and brotherhood like they claimed. They were just guys using each other until something better came along, and when you went down they forgot your name.

She'd already seen the truth. Might as well say it out loud.

"Yeah," I said. "Seeing Danny locked up... it scared me. Really scared me."

"What scared you about it?"

I thought about that visiting room. The smell of industrial cleaner. Danny's voice through the phone tinny and distant. His eyes hollow, like something had been scraped out.

"That I was looking at my future," I said finally. "Everyone already thought I'd end up there—next to Danny or in the cell down the hall. Sitting in that room I realized they were probably right. If I kept going the way I was, that's exactly where I'd be."

Amy was quiet for a moment. When she spoke, her voice was thoughtful. "It takes real courage to walk away from the only life you've known."

I laughed—sharp and bitter. "Courage? More like cowardice. The crew thinks I'm a traitor. Snake—the guy who runs things now—he told me I was being weak. That real men don't run when things get hard."

"That's not true." Amy's voice had an edge I'd never heard. "Real strength is making hard choices even when everyone around you says you're wrong. Walking away from something toxic takes more courage than staying ever could."

"Maybe." The word came out skeptical.

"Not maybe. Definitely." She tapped my paper. "You wrote that the hardest part wasn't leaving the crew. It was believing you deserved better than the life they offered. That's not cowardice, Marcus. That's growth."

Had I written that? I looked at my paper—the part where I'd talked about how Snake's words had dug into me, making me wonder if wanting something better was just proof I was soft, couldn't handle real life.

Yeah. I'd written it. Hadn't even realized I was admitting it until I saw Amy's reaction.

"I don't know if I deserve better," I admitted. "I made a lot of bad choices. Hurt people. Did things I can't take back."

"So you're just supposed to keep making bad choices forever? Because you made mistakes when you were sixteen?" Amy shook her head. "That's not how growth works. You don't have to stay who you were at your worst moment."

The words hit somewhere deep. Somewhere that had been carrying around the weight of every mistake, every stupid decision, every time I'd been exactly the Webb trash everyone expected.

"How do you know when you've actually changed?" I asked. "How do you know you're not just pretending to be better while you're still the same person underneath?"

Amy considered that. "I think real change is choosing to be different every day, even when it's hard. Even when the old life looks easier. You're doing that, Marcus. Every time you show up here instead of going back to your old crew. Every time you work through a GED lesson instead of giving up. That's real change."

"Or I'm just scared of jail."

"Maybe both can be true." She smiled slightly. "Fear can be a good motivator. But you're doing more than just avoiding consequences. You're building something new. That takes more than fear."

I didn't know what to say to that. Didn't know how to explain that sitting here with her twice a week had become the thing I looked forward to most, that her belief in me—quiet and steady and unwavering—was the first time anyone had looked at me and seen potential instead of problems.

"Your essay is really good," Amy said, switching back to tutor mode. "The structure needs work, and we'll expand this into a full five-paragraph format. But your ideas are clear and powerful. You're getting better at this."

"Thanks to you."

"No." She met my eyes. "Thanks to you doing the work. I can explain concepts, but you're the one who has to apply them. Don't discount your own effort."

---

The session continued—working through how to expand my paragraph, discussing thesis statements and supporting evidence.

But I couldn't stop thinking about Amy's words.

Real strength is making hard choices. You don't have to stay who you were at your worst moment. Real change is choosing to be different every day.

At three-thirty Amy packed up. "Same time Thursday?"

"Yeah."

She hesitated, then smiled and left, leaving me with an essay about my brother and words I couldn't shake.

That night I sat on my porch in the heat and thought about courage.

The crew defined it as physical—who could take a punch, who didn't flinch, who stood and fought. By that measure I'd been plenty courageous.

But walking into that library every day while people whispered? Sitting across from Amy admitting how far behind I was? Working toward a GED when I could've just served my hours and walked away?

Maybe Amy was right. Maybe that took a different kind of courage.

Inside, Mom watched television. She'd smiled when I came home, asked about my day. I'd told her tutoring was going well. Hadn't mentioned Amy specifically. Hadn't mentioned I was falling for a girl so far out of my league she might as well be on the moon.

Across the street the railroad tracks gleamed in the last light, that permanent dividing line cutting Riverside in half.

I'd spent eighteen years on the south side. Born here, raised here, expected to die here.

But for the first time I could see a different path. Narrow and uncertain, but there.

Amy had shown me it was there. Not by telling me I could be better. By treating me like I already was.

---

Thursday I showed up at 1:55. Amy was already there.

"Hey," she said, smiling. "Ready to expand that essay?"

I sat down and pulled out my notebook. "Before we start—can I ask you something?"

"Of course."

"Why do you do this? Tutor, I mean. You're volunteering all summer. You could be doing anything else. Why spend your time teaching guys like me?"

Amy's expression turned thoughtful. "Do you really want to know?"

"Yeah."

"Because education should be about opportunity, not just grades and applications. I've seen too many smart people give up because the system gave up on them first." She met my eyes. "And teaching you isn't a chore, Marcus. You care about learning. That makes it worthwhile."

The words settled over me, warm and dangerous.

She meant it. I could see it in her face—she actually meant it.

"Thank you," I managed. "For seeing something worth teaching."

"Thank you for proving me right."

We started the session, but something had shifted again. Another crack in the walls I'd built to keep distance between us.

Amy saw me. Really saw me. And she still chose to be here.

That was worth more than she could possibly know.

That was worth fighting to become the person she believed I could be.

Even if that fight scared the hell out of me.

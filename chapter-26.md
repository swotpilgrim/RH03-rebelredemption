# Chapter 26: Building a Case

The Riverside Police Department was a squat brick building on Oak Street, two blocks from the courthouse. I'd driven past it a hundred times, never thinking I'd walk through those doors voluntarily.

Mr. Donovan parked his station wagon in the lot. Amy sat in back with me, hand still holding mine.

"You sure about this?" Donovan asked, turning to look at me.

No. I wasn't sure about anything except that running would make it worse.

"Yeah," I said. "I'm sure."

Inside, the station smelled like coffee and floor cleaner. A desk sergeant looked up as we approached.

"Help you?"

"Marcus Webb," I said. Voice steadier than I felt. "Officer Garrett told me to turn myself in by nine."

Recognition flickered across the sergeant's face. "The Chen Electronics break-in. Yeah, we've been expecting you. Have a seat."

We sat on hard plastic chairs while the sergeant made a phone call. Amy's hand never left mine.

Ten minutes later Officer Garrett appeared from a back hallway. His expression was unreadable.

"Marcus. Mr. Donovan. Miss Parker." He nodded to each of us. "Let's talk in an interview room."

He led us down a hallway to a small room with a table and four chairs. A camera in the corner blinked red—everything recorded.

We sat. Garrett across from me, Donovan and Amy on either side.

"Before we process you," Garrett said, "I want to make sure you understand what's happening. You're being charged with burglary, criminal trespass, vandalism, and probation violation. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in court. You have the right to an attorney—"

"I know my rights," I said. "And I want to cooperate. I want to tell you everything about who planned it, who threatened me, all of it."

Garrett's eyebrows rose slightly. "You're willing to give a statement? Testify against the others involved?"

"Yes."

"That's... unexpected." He pulled out a notepad. "Usually guys in your position lawyer up and keep quiet."

"I've been keeping quiet my whole life," I said. "It hasn't gotten me anywhere good."

Donovan spoke up. "Officer Garrett, before Marcus gives any statement, he needs legal representation. I've contacted Sarah Chen from County Legal Aid. She's on her way."

Garrett nodded. "That's smart. We'll wait for counsel." He stood. "I'll get the paperwork started. Marcus, you'll be processed and held here until your arraignment—probably tomorrow morning. After that, likely county jail until trial or plea."

The reality of it hit me fresh. Tomorrow morning I'd be in orange jumpsuit standing before a judge. Then jail. Then—eventually—prison.

Amy's hand tightened on mine.

Garrett left. We sat in silence.

"You're doing the right thing," Donovan said quietly.

I wanted to believe him.

Sarah Chen arrived forty-five minutes later. She was younger than I expected—maybe early thirties—with sharp eyes and a messenger bag full of files.

"Marcus Webb?" She offered her hand. I shook it. "Sarah Chen, County Legal Aid. Mr. Donovan gave me the basics over the phone but I need to hear your full story. From the beginning."

So for what felt like the hundredth time, I told it. Snake's threats, Garrett's inability to help, Saturday night, getting caught on camera. This time I added every detail I could remember—dates, times, exactly what Snake said, the other guys involved, the photos he'd threatened to send.

Sarah took notes, asking sharp questions. Where exactly did Snake threaten you? Who else was present? Did anyone see or hear? Do you have texts or calls from him?

When I finished she sat back, thinking.

"Okay," she said finally. "Here's where we are. The charges are serious. Burglary alone carries two to six years in California. Add the probation violation and we're looking at significant prison time."

My stomach sank.

"However," she continued, "we have mitigating factors. You're eighteen—technically an adult but still young. No adult criminal record. You've been complying with probation until this incident—Mr. Donovan confirms that. You have documented coercion from a known gang member."

"Is that enough?" Amy asked.

"Depends on the DA." Sarah tapped her pen on the notepad. "If Marcus is willing to testify against James Morrison and the others involved, that gives us leverage. The police want the crew leadership more than they want you, Marcus. You're a kid who made mistakes. Morrison is a career criminal recruiting minors."

"So if I testify they'll go easy on me?"

"I can't promise anything," she said honestly. "But I can argue for a reduced sentence. Present your GED progress—you passed the test?"

"In jail," I said. "I'll have my certificate by then."

"Good. That shows rehabilitation efforts. Mr. Donovan's testimony about your work ethic and character. Your mother's testimony about the threats to her safety." She looked at me directly. "If you cooperate fully, if we can show the judge you were coerced and are genuinely trying to change, we might get you two years instead of four. Maybe less with good behavior."

Two years. Still a lifetime. Still losing everything.

But better than four.

"There's one thing you need to understand," Sarah said. "The second you agree to testify against Morrison, you're putting a target on your back. The crew doesn't forgive snitches."

"I know."

"You'll need protective custody in county jail. Possibly in prison too, depending on where you're placed." She watched me carefully. "Are you prepared for that? For what testifying means?"

I thought about the crew code. About loyalty and brotherhood and never snitching.

Then I looked at Amy sitting beside me, exhausted and worried but still here. At Mr. Donovan who'd treated me with more respect in six months than the crew had in two years.

Real loyalty wasn't blind obedience. It was people who showed up when things got hard. Who believed in you even when you didn't believe in yourself. Who gave you chances you didn't deserve.

The crew had used me. Snake had threatened the people I cared about, manipulated me into throwing away my future, then abandoned me the second things went wrong.

That wasn't brotherhood. That was exploitation.

"I'll testify," I said. "Against Snake, against Rico and J.T., against anyone involved. I'll tell the cops everything I know about crew operations. All of it."

Sarah nodded. "Then let's build your case."

---

The next two hours were a blur. Giving an official statement to Garrett with Sarah present. Answering questions about the crew's structure, their usual operations, every job I'd been part of before I tried to go straight.

It felt like betrayal at first. Like crossing a line I'd spent years learning never to cross.

But every time doubt crept in, I remembered Snake's cold smile in the library parking lot. The knife at the depot. The way he'd used me without caring what it cost.

This wasn't betrayal. This was survival.

When we finished, Garrett said they'd contact me about when I'd need to testify. Then it was time for processing.

"I need to say goodbye," I told Sarah.

She nodded. "You have a few minutes."

Donovan hugged me—unexpected and brief. "You'll get through this," he said. "And when you come out, if you still want to work on that GED college prep, my door's open."

I couldn't speak past the lump in my throat. Just nodded.

Then he left, giving me and Amy privacy.

She stood facing me, eyes red from crying but expression determined.

"I'll write," she said. "Every week. And I'll visit when they allow it."

"You don't have to—"

"Stop." She put her hand on my chest. "We already had this conversation. I'm choosing this. Let me."

"Okay." I covered her hand with mine. "Thank you. For everything. For not giving up on me. For being here."

"I love you," she said simply. "That doesn't go away just because things get hard."

Hearing her say it—actually say those words—made everything hurt and heal at the same time.

"I love you too," I said. "And I promise when I get out I'll be better. I'll work on trusting people. On being honest. On being the guy you see instead of the guy I think I am."

"I'll hold you to that." She stood on her toes and kissed me gently. Just once, brief and sweet and full of promise.

When she pulled back her eyes were wet but she was smiling.

"Two years goes faster than you think," she said.

"I hope so."

"Marcus?" Garrett appeared in the doorway. "Time."

Amy squeezed my hand one last time, then let go.

I followed Garrett down the hallway to booking.

They took my personal items, my belt, my shoelaces. Fingerprinted me. Photographed me. Gave me an orange jumpsuit that smelled like industrial detergent.

Put me in a holding cell to wait for tomorrow's arraignment.

I sat on the hard bench, head in my hands, trying not to think about the next two years. Trying to focus on what came after instead—freedom, Amy, the chance to prove I'd learned something from all this.

It was the longest night of my life.

But at least I'd stopped running.

At least I'd finally made the right choice, even if it was too late to save myself from the consequences.

At least I wasn't alone anymore.

Amy's last words echoed: *Two years goes faster than you think.*

I hoped she was right.

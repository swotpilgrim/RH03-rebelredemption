# Chapter 20: The Line

Officer Garrett's office smelled like old coffee and disinfectant. Thursday morning, I sat across from his metal desk trying not to look as nervous as I felt.

Amy had walked me through what to say. But sitting here under Garrett's skeptical stare, all those careful points scattered.

"You said you had something important to tell me." Garrett leaned back, arms crossed.

I cleared my throat. "Someone from my old crew approached me. James Morrison. Snake. He wants me to help with a job this weekend."

"What kind of job?"

"Breaking and entering, probably. Theft." The words came easier once I started. "I told him I was done with that life, but he threatened me. Said if I don't show up Saturday night, he'll go after people I care about."

Garrett was quiet, studying me. "You have proof? Text messages, witnesses?"

My stomach sank. "No. Just his word."

"So it's your word against his about a conversation no one else heard."

"Yes, but—"

"Marcus." Garrett leaned forward, elbows on his desk. "I hear what you're saying. But without evidence, without a crime actually being committed, there's nothing I can do. I can't arrest someone for allegedly threatening you."

"I'm not asking you to arrest him. I'm asking—" What was I asking? For help? For protection? For someone in the system to care that I was being backed into a corner? "I'm trying to do the right thing here. I'm trying to stay clean."

"And that's good. That's what you should be doing."

"But Snake won't let me. He's going to keep pushing until I either help him or—"

"Or what?"

"Or he destroys the people I care about."

Garrett sighed, a sound I recognized—tired frustration with a problem he couldn't solve. "Look, I get it. I know how these crews operate. Loyalty, pressure, threats. It's how they keep guys like you in line."

"So what am I supposed to do?"

"Make better choices."

The words hit like a slap.

"Better choices?" My voice rose. "I'm here telling you what's happening before it happens and you're telling me to make better choices?"

"If you participate in any criminal activity—for any reason, even if you're being threatened—you violate your probation." Garrett's voice was flat. "And that means adult prison, Marcus."

"Even if I'm being coerced?"

"Coercion is a defense you can try in court. But it won't stop the violation." He spread his hands. "I'm sorry. Those are the rules."

I stared at him. "So I'm supposed to just hope Snake gives up?"

"I'm saying don't commit crimes. That's the one thing you can actually control."

"And when he goes after the people I care about?"

"Then they can file police reports. Get restraining orders."

Legal remedies that took time. That required proof. That assumed the system worked for guys like me.

I stood up, chair scraping loud. "Thanks for your time."

"If Morrison contacts you again, document it. Build a case."

A case that would take months. By then Snake would have already destroyed Amy's future.

"Sure," I said.

I walked out feeling like I'd just used up my last lifeline and found it broken.

---

The library shift dragged. I shelved books on autopilot, mind racing through options that didn't exist.

Garrett couldn't help. Wouldn't help, more like. The system wasn't designed to protect guys like me—it was designed to catch us when we fell.

At three o'clock I was hauling a cart of returns across the main floor when I saw Snake's car pull into the parking lot through the front windows.

My blood went cold.

He sat there, engine idling, waiting. Watching the entrance.

I abandoned the cart and headed for the back exit, but Mr. Donovan called out asking me to help a patron reach a high shelf. By the time I finished, twenty minutes had passed.

Snake's car was gone.

I let out a breath I didn't know I'd been holding and finished my shift. At four-thirty I grabbed my keys and headed out the front doors.

Snake was leaning against my truck.

"Marcus." He smiled, all teeth and no warmth. "Right on time."

I stopped walking. The parking lot was mostly empty—a few cars scattered around, but no people. No witnesses.

"We need to talk," Snake said.

"I'm not doing your job."

"Funny. That's not what I heard." He pushed off from my truck, closing the distance between us. "See, I checked in with some mutual friends. Asked if anyone had seen you around. Know what I found out?"

My throat was tight. "What."

"That you had a real interesting conversation with your probation officer this morning. Early meeting. Real serious." Snake's smile disappeared. "You trying to snitch on me, Marcus?"

"I told him you were pressuring me. That's not snitching, that's trying to stay clean."

"That's the same damn thing." He stepped closer, voice dropping to something dangerous. "You know the rules. You don't talk to cops. You don't talk to probation. You sure as hell don't go running to the authorities about crew business."

"I'm not in the crew anymore."

"You're in until I say you're out." He jabbed a finger at my chest. "And right now, you're in deep. Saturday night, eleven p.m., depot. That's not a request anymore, Marcus. That's an order."

"I can't." My voice came out rough. "I violate probation and I go to prison. Real prison."

"Should've thought about that before you turned your back on your brothers."

"Danny's in county because of crew business. I'm not following him there."

Snake's expression went cold. "Danny's in county because he got sloppy. You won't, because I'm better at planning than his old crew was. You show up, you follow orders, you're home by two a.m. No one gets caught, no one gets hurt."

"Unless something goes wrong."

"Nothing's going wrong. Not if you do your job."

"I'm not doing it, Snake."

The words hung between us. Final. A line drawn that I couldn't take back.

Snake was quiet for a long moment. Then he smiled, and it was worse than his anger.

"Okay," he said softly. "Okay. You want to play it that way? Fine." He pulled out his phone, tapped the screen, turned it to show me a photo.

It was me and Amy. Thursday afternoon outside the library, heads close together, her hand on my arm. Taken from across the street, zoomed in but clear enough to see our faces.

"Got about twenty more like this," Snake said. "Real cozy study sessions you two have been having. Makes a guy wonder what else you've been studying besides books."

My hands curled into fists. "Delete that."

"Or what? You gonna hit me? Go ahead. Assault your old crew leader in broad daylight. See how fast that violates your probation." He pocketed the phone. "No, Marcus. You're gonna listen. Because here's what's going to happen if you don't show up Saturday."

He stepped closer, voice going quiet and vicious.

"Sunday morning I'm going to send these photos to Amy's daddy. Gonna have a real interesting conversation about how his college-bound daughter's been sneaking around with a criminal. With a guy who violated probation. With someone who's about to go to prison for running with his old crew."

"That's not—"

"Doesn't matter if it's true. What matters is what it looks like. And this looks bad, Marcus. Real bad. Small-town girl keeping company with gang trash? Her daddy's gonna lose his mind. Her college applications? Destroyed. Her reputation? Gone. All because you were too selfish to do one simple job for the brothers who had your back when no one else did."

"You're lying. You don't have that kind of reach."

"Try me." His smile was cruel. "I got friends, Marcus. Friends who'd be real happy to make some anonymous calls to Stanford. To her church. To everyone in this town who thinks the Parker girl is so perfect. They'll know she's been slumming it with a Webb."

I couldn't breathe. Couldn't think past the image of Amy's face when her whole life fell apart because of me.

"Leave her out of this," I said, voice shaking. "Please."

"Then do the job."

"Snake—"

"Saturday night. Eleven p.m. Depot." He turned and walked toward his car, then stopped and looked back. "Oh, and Marcus? Don't tell anyone about our conversation. Not your probation officer, not your librarian friend, and definitely not your girlfriend. You talk, and I send those photos first thing tomorrow morning. You feel me?"

I didn't answer. Couldn't.

Snake got in his car and drove away, leaving me standing alone in the parking lot with my world collapsing around me.

---

I sat in my truck for twenty minutes trying to pull myself together.

Garrett had been my last hope of finding a way out through the system. That was dead.

Amy had been right about Snake not stopping with one job. But she'd been wrong about me being able to stand up to him. Because Snake didn't care about rules or consequences. He cared about control.

And now he had photos. Evidence of me and Amy that he could twist into something ugly enough to destroy her future.

If I did the job, I went to prison.

If I didn't do the job, Amy paid the price.

I started the truck and drove home, numb and defeated.

At the house I texted Amy before I could lose my nerve: *Can't make Tuesday's session. Some stuff came up. Won't be around for a while.*

Her response came fast: *What kind of stuff? Are you okay?*

I stared at the message, then turned off my phone.

Saturday night. Forty-eight hours away.

Forty-eight hours until I destroyed everything I'd been trying to build.

I sat in the dark living room as the sun set, feeling the weight of impossible choices crushing down on me. No matter what I did, someone got hurt.

And the worst part was knowing I'd brought this on myself. If I'd never joined the crew, never made those mistakes, never been Danny Webb's screwup little brother, none of this would be happening.

Amy would be safe. My future wouldn't be balanced on a knife's edge.

But I had joined. I had made those mistakes. And now the past I'd been trying to outrun had finally caught up.

Snake had won.

And Saturday night, I'd prove it.

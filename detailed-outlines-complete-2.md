- Amy gets quiet, then says she's not fragile and she's tired of people making decisions for her like she's some delicate thing to be protected. She asks what Marcus wants to do.

- Amy says then Marcus needs to break the cycle now instead of later. She offers to go with him to talk to Garrett. Marcus says absolutely not, she's not getting more involved in his mess than she already is.
- Amy says she's already involved—she cares about him and he doesn't get to decide she stops caring just because things got hard. The admission hangs between them.

- Marcus tells Snake he's out, this isn't what was agreed to. Snake pulls a knife, presses it close. Says Marcus is in whether he likes it or not.

- Rita says then maybe he can fix this before it's completely broken. She tells him he can't run from consequences but he can choose how he faces them. Marcus knows she's right.

- Marcus tries to explain he was protecting her but Amy cuts him off. Says he was protecting himself from having to trust someone, from having to believe someone might actually care about him enough to fight for him. The words hit Marcus hard because they're completely true.
- Amy asks what Marcus wants now—to go to prison convinced he saved her, or to actually fight for the life he's been building? Marcus admits he doesn't know how to fight this, it feels impossible. Amy says then he needs to learn because she's not walking away. She cares about him too much to watch him give up.
- She asks if he cares about her. Marcus, raw and honest and with nothing left to lose, says he's in love with her. Amy's anger cracks. She's quiet for moment then says then he needs to stop making decisions alone. They talk to Mr. Donovan together about what options Marcus has.

**Beats:**
- Mr. Donovan contacts a legal aid lawyer he knows. By afternoon the lawyer arrives—a woman named Sarah Chen who handles juvenile and young adult cases. She explains Marcus faces serious charges but there are mitigating factors: coercion, no adult record, cooperation with authorities.
- If Marcus testifies against Snake and the crew, explains the threats in detail, shows evidence of trying to go straight (GED progress, Donovan's testimony, community service completion), the DA might offer a deal. She can't guarantee but it's a chance. Better than going down for Snake's crimes.
- She asks if Marcus is willing to testify against his old crew. Marcus thinks about the code—you don't snitch, loyalty means everything. Then looks at Amy sitting beside him and realizes the crew was never loyal to him. They used him. Real loyalty is what Amy's showing: believing in him even when he screwed up.

- Amy testifies that Marcus told her about the threats and she believes he was trying to protect her even though he made the wrong choice. Her testimony is powerful—she doesn't excuse his actions but speaks to his character and his growth. She meets Marcus's eyes while testifying and he has to look away because seeing her faith in him hurts.
- Prosecutor argues Marcus still committed crimes and violated probation. Judge is stern. Says Marcus made terrible choices but showed responsibility by turning himself in and cooperating.

**Beats:**
- February morning Marcus walks out of county jail. Six months felt like years but he survived. Got his GED inside—studied every day, passed the test, has the certificate in his hand when Rita picks him up. They drive home and the silence feels different—companionable instead of disappointed.
- At house Marcus showers for the first time without someone watching, changes into clean clothes that smell like home instead of jail. Tries to adjust to freedom. His probation is strict—curfew, check-ins, job requirements—but he follows every rule because he's done screwing up.
- Wednesday morning Marcus goes back to the library. Mr. Donovan has held his community service position—Marcus still has hours to complete from before his arrest. Donovan welcomes him back matter-of-factly, no big deal, just puts him to work shelving books.
- Marcus is shelving when he feels someone watching. Turns and Amy is there. She looks different—older, more sure of herself. Home for winter break from her first semester at community college.

- Marcus tells her about getting his GED in jail, about the deal he made with himself to actually become the person she believed he could be. About reading constantly, studying to keep from going crazy. Amy says she never doubted he could do it. Marcus says she should have—he doubted himself every single day.
- Amy smiles and says that's what made his choice real: he did it despite the doubt. They talk about the six months apart—Amy admits her mother is still not happy about her caring for Marcus but Amy stopped letting that control her choices. Marcus says he doesn't want to mess up her life. Amy says he doesn't get to decide what messes up her life—she does.
- She asks if Marcus still feels the same way he did before.

- Amy says she knows he can. They sit on the library steps watching sunset over Riverside, hands intertwined. Marcus realizes redemption isn't about erasing his past—it's about choosing every day to be better than he was.

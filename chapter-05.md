# Chapter 5: First Session

Tuesday morning crawled by like it had somewhere else to be and was taking its time getting there.

I shelved books with hands that wanted to shake. Broke down delivery boxes with more force than necessary. Swept aisles that didn't need sweeping just to keep moving, keep busy, keep from thinking about two o'clock.

At one-thirty Donovan found me reorganizing the magazine rack for the third time.

"Marcus. The magazines are fine."

I stepped back, shoving my hands in my pockets. "Yes, sir."

"Amy's already set up at table three." He gave me a look that was almost sympathetic. "She doesn't bite."

"I know, sir."

"Do you?" Donovan's expression softened slightly. "She's a good teacher. Patient. If you put in the work, you'll learn. That's all this is—work."

Easy for him to say. He wasn't about to sit across from a girl with college in her future and prove he could barely remember algebra.

But I nodded, and when my shift ended at two I walked toward table three like a man walking to his own execution.

---

Amy was already there.

She'd claimed the table in the back corner, away from the main reading area but close to the reference section where the light from the tall windows was good. Textbooks were stacked neatly to one side. Paper and pencils organized in the middle. She wore a pale yellow cardigan over a white blouse, her hair pulled back in its usual ponytail, those pearl earrings catching the afternoon light.

She looked up when I approached and smiled—not the polite smile she gave patrons, but something warmer. Real.

"Hi, Marcus."

Her voice was calm, matter-of-fact. No pity. No condescension. Like this was just another normal thing happening on a Tuesday afternoon.

"Hi." I stood there awkwardly, not sure if I should sit or wait for permission or what the protocol was for voluntary humiliation sessions.

"Have a seat." She gestured to the chair across from her. "I'm glad you decided to do this."

I sat, the wooden chair creaking slightly under my weight. Up close I could see her face clearly—light dusting of freckles across her nose, hazel eyes that looked more green than brown in this light, small scar on her chin that I'd never noticed before.

Focus, Webb. This isn't a date. This is you proving you're not completely stupid.

"So," Amy began, pulling one of the textbooks closer, "Mr. Donovan said you're interested in working toward your GED?"

"Yes." The word came out rougher than intended. I cleared my throat. "Yes, ma'am."

Her lips twitched like she was fighting a smile. "You don't have to call me ma'am. I'm seventeen."

"Okay."

"Before we start studying, I need to figure out where you're at academically. It's not a test—there's no passing or failing. I just need to know what you already know so we can make a plan." She slid a workbook across the table. "This has some basic questions covering reading, writing, math, science, and social studies. Take your time and answer what you can. If you don't know something, that's fine. Just skip it and move to the next one."

I stared at the workbook like it might bite me. "How long do I have?"

"As long as you need. We have an hour, but if you don't finish today we'll continue Thursday." She pulled a stack of papers toward herself. "I'll work on grading while you do that. Give you some space."

Space. Like she understood that having her watch me struggle would make it ten times worse.

I opened the workbook.

The first section was reading comprehension—a passage about the California Gold Rush followed by questions. I read it through once, then again, trying to remember what English teachers had said about finding main ideas and supporting details. The passage wasn't complicated, but the questions made my brain feel slow and clumsy.

I answered what I could and moved on.

Math started simple—addition, subtraction, multiplication. Then fractions, which I'd never understood even when I was still in school. Decimals that might as well have been a foreign language. I worked through the problems methodically, double-checking my answers, aware that each wrong answer was proof of exactly how far behind I was.

Twenty minutes in, my hand was cramping and frustration was building in my chest like pressure in an engine about to blow.

I glanced up.

Amy was bent over her papers, red pen moving in quick efficient strokes. Her brow was furrowed in concentration, bottom lip caught between her teeth. She looked completely absorbed in whatever she was grading, like she'd forgotten I was even there.

Something about that helped. If she wasn't watching, wasn't judging, I could just focus on the work.

I went back to the problems.

Science section asked about basic biology and earth science—things I vaguely remembered from freshman year before I'd stopped paying attention. Social studies covered American history and government. I knew more than I expected here, probably from Danny's habit of getting into arguments about politics back when he was still home.

Forty minutes later I set down my pencil.

Amy looked up immediately, like she'd been waiting. "All done?"

"Yeah. I mean, I skipped some. Didn't know the answers."

"That's fine. That's what this is for." She held out her hand and I slid the workbook across the table.

She flipped through the pages, her expression giving nothing away. I sat there trying not to fidget, trying not to imagine what she was thinking as she saw exactly how many questions I'd gotten wrong.

After what felt like an hour but was probably three minutes, Amy set the workbook down and looked at me with those clear eyes.

"Okay. So here's what I'm seeing." She turned the book so we could both look at it. "Your reading comprehension is actually pretty strong. You got most of these questions right, and the ones you missed were more about unfamiliarity with test format than not understanding the passage."

I blinked. "Really?"

"Really. You're a good reader, Marcus. Better than some of my other students."

Something in my chest loosened slightly.

"Math is where we'll need to focus," she continued. "Basic operations are fine, but fractions and decimals need work. That's normal—lots of people struggle there. We'll spend time on that." She flipped pages. "Science and social studies are mixed. Some gaps in knowledge, but you have a good foundation to build on."

She wasn't sugarcoating it, but she wasn't making me feel stupid either. Just stating facts, like a mechanic telling you which parts of your engine needed work.

"So what does that mean?" I asked.

"It means we start with reading comprehension and writing since those are your strengths. Build confidence there while we work on math fundamentals. Once you're solid on fractions and decimals, we'll move to algebra and geometry." She pulled a notebook from her stack and opened it to a blank page. "For science and social studies, we'll use practice tests to identify specific gaps and target those."

She was making a plan. An actual plan, like she believed I could do this.

"How long does it usually take?" The question came out before I could stop it. "To be ready for the GED test?"

Amy considered. "Depends on the student and how much time they put in. If we work together twice a week and you study between sessions, maybe six months? Could be less if you work hard."

Six months. My community service would be done in four, but I could keep coming after if I wanted. If Amy was still willing.

"I'll work hard," I heard myself say.

She smiled—that real smile that transformed her whole face. "I know you will. Mr. Donovan wouldn't have suggested this if he didn't think you could do it."

We spent the rest of the hour going over a reading passage together. Amy asked me questions about what I'd read, about how I knew the answers, about strategies for breaking down complicated sentences. She explained things clearly, never talking down to me, never making me feel stupid for not knowing.

When I got something right, she'd nod and say "Exactly" or "Good." When I got something wrong, she'd just ask questions that led me to the right answer without making me feel like an idiot for missing it the first time.

The hour flew by.

"That's probably enough for today," Amy said, glancing at the clock on the wall. It was past three. "Same time Thursday?"

"Yeah. Yes. Same time Thursday."

She started gathering her materials. I stood, not sure what to do with my hands.

"Marcus?"

I looked at her.

"You did well today. I mean it. You're smarter than you think you are."

The words hit somewhere deep, in a place that still remembered being a kid who liked reading, who got excited about learning things, before everything had gone wrong.

"Thank you," I managed.

She smiled again and I left before I could do something stupid like keep standing there staring at her.

Outside, the afternoon heat hit like a wall. I walked to my truck in a daze, climbed in, and sat there with my hands on the wheel.

That had been... not terrible.

Amy had been patient, clear, never once looked at me like I was wasting her time or too stupid to bother with. She'd made a plan like she actually believed I could get my GED. Like it was just a matter of work, not some impossible dream for a Webb from south of the tracks.

I started the truck and headed home, replaying the session in my mind.

"You're smarter than you think you are."

No one had said anything like that to me in years. Teachers had given up on me by sophomore year. Mom loved me but she'd stopped hoping I'd amount to anything after Danny went in. The crew had wanted me for my fists and my loyalty, not my brain.

But Amy Parker—good girl, hardware store princess, probably perfect grades and a perfect future—had looked at my assessment test and seen something worth teaching.

That night I pulled out the old notebook again and actually wrote down what we'd covered. Reading comprehension strategies. The stuff about topic sentences and supporting details. Notes on how to approach test questions.

Across the hall, Danny's room sat empty and dark.

I wasn't him. I didn't have to follow his path.

Maybe—just maybe—I could actually do this.

Thursday at two o'clock, I'd find out.

# Chapter 2: Books and Judgment

The woman at the front desk looked like she'd swallowed something sour.

"Can I help you?" Her tone said she'd rather do anything but.

"I'm supposed to see Mr. Donovan. Community service." The words tasted bitter but I got them out.

Recognition flickered across her face—the kind that meant she knew exactly who I was and what I'd done to end up here. Small towns are like that. Your business becomes everyone's business before you've even finished making your mistakes.

"Wait here." She disappeared through a doorway marked STAFF ONLY, leaving me standing in the lobby like something that might contaminate the books.

I shoved my hands in my jacket pockets and studied the place. High ceilings with dark wood beams. Shelves stretching back into quiet rows. Reading tables where a few people sat with newspapers and books, all of them sneaking glances at me when they thought I wasn't looking. A kid's section in the corner with bright posters advertising the summer reading program—some cartoon bear holding a stack of books, encouraging children to "Read Your Way Through Summer!"

The air smelled like paper and dust and furniture polish, underlaid with something else. Order, maybe. Rules. The kind of place where people spoke in hushed tones and knew how to behave, where leather jackets and crew tattoos stood out like blood on fresh snow.

I was turning to check the clock on the wall when a man emerged from the staff area. Tall, maybe fifty, with iron-gray hair cut military-short and posture to match. He wore slacks and a button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled to his elbows, revealing forearms corded with muscle that said he hadn't always worked in a library.

"Marcus Webb?" His voice carried authority without needing volume.

"Yes, sir."

"Albert Donovan. Head librarian." He extended his hand.

I shook it, surprised by the firm grip and the fact that he'd offered at all. Most people in Riverside wouldn't touch me if they could help it.

"Follow me."

He led me through the staff door into a small office lined with bookshelves. A desk sat beneath a window overlooking Main Street, its surface neat except for a stack of papers and a coffee mug. On the wall hung a framed photograph of younger men in military uniforms standing beside a Jeep—Korea, maybe, or just after.

Donovan gestured to a chair. I sat.

"Judge Harrison sent over your paperwork." He tapped a folder on his desk. "Two hundred hours. Weekly reports to your probation officer. Zero tolerance for violations."

"Yes, sir."

"I don't believe in coddling or second-guessing the judge's decision," Donovan continued. "You're here because you made choices that put you here. What you do with this opportunity is up to you."

I waited. There was usually more—lectures about wasting potential, disappointed speeches about kids these days, warnings about staying away from the nice patrons. But Donovan just leaned back in his chair and studied me with sharp eyes that missed nothing.

"Your duties will include shelving returned books, basic cleaning and maintenance, and helping with preparation for library programs. Summer reading is our busiest season. You'll work Monday through Friday, nine to one. Four hours daily until you've completed your service. Understood?"

"Yes, sir."

"Library rules are simple. Keep noise to a minimum. Treat the materials with respect. Show up on time. If you're going to be late or absent, you call ahead. Questions?"

"No, sir."

"Good." He stood. "Let's get you started."

Donovan showed me the returns desk where patrons dropped off books, the wheeled cart I'd use to transport them, and the shelving system I'd need to learn. Dewey Decimal for non-fiction. Alphabetical by author for fiction. Children's books by age level and category. It was more complicated than I'd expected, but Donovan explained it clearly, demonstrating once and then watching while I tried.

"You'll get the hang of it," he said when I hesitated over whether a book belonged in 641 or 642. "Speed matters less than accuracy. A mis-shelved book is a lost book."

He left me with a cart of returns and instructions to come find him if I had questions.

I started shelving.

The library was busier than I'd expected for a Wednesday morning. Mothers with small children heading to story time in the children's section. Old men claiming the newspapers and comfortable chairs near the windows. A couple of women browsing the new releases, talking in whispers that somehow carried in the quiet.

And every single one of them noticed me.

I felt their eyes tracking my movement through the stacks. Heard conversations pause when I rolled my cart past. Saw the way mothers steered their children to different aisles, the way the old men looked up from their papers with suspicion hardening their faces.

The Webb boy. The one who runs with that gang. Brother's in jail, you know. Headed there himself, mark my words.

I didn't need to hear the actual words. I'd been hearing variations of them my whole life.

I kept my head down and shelved books. Science fiction in the 800s. Westerns alphabetically under L for L'Amour. A thick novel about the Civil War that belonged in historical fiction. The work was mindless but required enough focus that I could almost forget the weight of judgment pressing down from every corner of the building.

Almost.

I was shelving in the history section when I heard it—a woman's voice, not bothering to whisper quite enough.

"I don't understand why Albert would bring someone like that in here. Around children."

"Court-ordered, I heard. Community service instead of jail."

"Well, I'll be keeping my eye on him. You can't trust those boys from south of the tracks. Bad blood runs in families."

My hands tightened on the book I was holding—some thick volume about World War II—hard enough that my knuckles went white. Bad blood. Like we were dogs that might bite if you got too close.

I shoved the book onto the shelf harder than necessary and moved my cart to the next section.

Around eleven o'clock I noticed her.

She sat at a table in the corner near the windows, working with a kid who couldn't have been more than eight or nine. The kid was struggling with a reader, his finger moving slowly under the words, his face scrunched with concentration. The girl leaned close, pointing at something on the page, her voice too low for me to hear but her patience obvious in the way she waited while the kid sounded out each syllable.

She was maybe my age, maybe a year younger. Pretty in a way that had nothing to do with makeup or trying too hard—clean features, hair pulled back in a neat ponytail, a cardigan sweater over a simple dress despite the heat outside. Pearl earrings caught the light when she turned her head.

Everything about her screamed respectable. Right side of the tracks. The kind of girl whose parents had plans for her that definitely didn't include noticing guys like me.

I looked away and kept shelving.

But my cart route took me past her table twice more that morning, and I couldn't help glancing over. She had a way of tilting her head when she listened to the kid read, a small smile when he got a word right, gentle corrections when he stumbled. When the session ended she walked the kid to the front desk where his mother was waiting, said something that made the mother smile, and returned to her table to organize papers.

The third time my cart rattled past, she looked up.

Our eyes met for maybe two seconds. She had hazel eyes, I noticed, even from across the aisle. Clear and direct, without the fear or disgust I'd gotten used to seeing.

Then I looked away first, heat creeping up the back of my neck, and shoved books onto shelves like my life depended on getting the damn cart empty.

What was I doing? Girls like that didn't look at guys like me. And even if they did, I had no business looking back. I was here to serve my time and stay out of jail, not to notice pearl earrings and patient smiles.

I kept my eyes on the books after that.

One o'clock came eventually.

Donovan found me in the non-fiction section, inspected my work with a quick eye, and gave a brief nod. "Acceptable. Same time tomorrow."

"Yes, sir."

"You did fine today, Marcus. Show up on time tomorrow and we won't have problems."

The words were matter-of-fact, neither praise nor criticism. Somehow that made them matter more than they should have.

I walked out of the library into the afternoon heat, climbed into my truck, and sat there for a minute with my hands on the steering wheel.

One day down. One hundred and ninety-nine hours to go.

The number felt impossible. Six weeks of showing up at this place where I didn't belong, feeling eyes on me, hearing whispered judgments, shelving books for people who'd cross the street to avoid me outside these walls.

I started the engine on the second try and headed home.

But as I drove, I kept thinking about hazel eyes that had looked at me without fear. About a girl in a cardigan tutoring kids with patience I didn't know existed. About the fact that in four hours of hostile stares and whispered insults, that one brief glance had been the only thing that felt like I was being seen as something other than the Webb boy heading nowhere good.

I told myself it didn't matter.

Told myself she was exactly the kind of complication I couldn't afford.

Told myself to forget about her and focus on surviving the next hundred and ninety-nine hours.

But when I pulled into my driveway and killed the engine, I realized I didn't even know her name.

And I hated that I wanted to.

# Chapter 21: Saturday Night

The abandoned depot sat at the edge of town where the railroad tracks curved east toward Los Angeles. I'd been here a hundred times before—back when I ran with the crew, when this place felt like freedom instead of a trap.

Now it just felt like the end of everything.

I parked my truck next to Snake's Chevy at ten-fifty Saturday night. My hands were shaking so bad I had to grip the steering wheel to make them stop. Through the cracked windshield I could see shadows moving inside the depot—at least two other guys already here.

Forty-eight hours ago I'd promised Amy I'd talk to Garrett, find another way. I'd tried. And the system had failed me just like I knew it would.

Now I was here, about to throw away my future to protect hers.

I got out of the truck before I could talk myself out of it.

The depot's door hung crooked on broken hinges. Inside smelled like cigarettes and motor oil and the sharp tang of spray paint. Snake stood in the center of the concrete floor with two other guys I hadn't seen in months—Rico and J.T., both younger than me, both looking at me like I was already a traitor.

"Marcus." Snake's voice echoed in the empty space. "Wasn't sure you'd show."

"I'm here." My voice came out flat, dead.

"Good. Good." Snake gestured to the other guys. "You remember Rico and J.T. They're gonna help us with tonight's work."

I nodded at them. Rico looked away. J.T. just stared, crowbar hanging loose in his hand.

The crowbar made my stomach twist.

"So what's the job?" I asked, trying to sound normal. Trying to pretend this was just another night, just another score, instead of me signing away everything I'd built.

"Warehouse over on Industrial Boulevard," Snake said. "Owner's a guy named Chen. Runs an electronics import business."

"We're stealing electronics?"

"We're collecting what's owed." Snake's smile was cold. "Chen hired the crew to do some protection work last year. Then decided he didn't want to pay. Thought he could just walk away from his obligations."

My throat was tight. "So this is about revenge."

"This is about respect. About showing people you don't screw over the Riverside Crew without consequences."

I looked at Rico and J.T. again. Both armed—Rico with the crowbar, J.T. with something bulky in his jacket pocket that looked a lot like a gun.

"You said this was quick in-out," I said carefully. "Just stealing some merchandise."

"It is quick." Snake walked over to a duffel bag on the floor and pulled out another crowbar, tossed it to me. I caught it on instinct. "Break in, take what we can carry, leave a message. Two hours tops."

"What kind of message?"

"The kind that makes it clear Chen made a mistake." Snake pulled out a can of spray paint and shook it. The metal ball rattled loud in the quiet. "You got a problem with that?"

Every part of me screamed that this was wrong. This wasn't just theft—this was destruction, intimidation, violence waiting to happen. The kind of job that got people hurt. The kind that turned into something worse when things went sideways.

"I thought we were just taking electronics," I said.

"We are. And we're making sure Chen understands why." Snake's eyes went hard. "You got a problem with the plan, Marcus?"

I looked at the crowbar in my hands. At Rico and J.T. watching me. At Snake waiting for me to object so he'd have an excuse to do—what? Pull that knife again? Follow through on his threats about Amy?

"No," I said. Hating myself. "No problem."

"Good." Snake checked his watch. "Eleven-fifteen. Warehouse closes at eleven, Chen should be gone by now. Security's just one camera at the front entrance. We go in the back, do our work, we're out before anyone notices."

"What about alarms?"

"Interior alarm, yeah. But we'll be fast. Cops won't show for at least ten minutes. Plenty of time." He looked at all of us. "Everybody clear on the plan?"

Rico and J.T. nodded.

I didn't move.

Snake walked over to me, close enough I could smell the cigarette smoke on his jacket. "You clear, Marcus?"

"Yeah." The word tasted like poison. "I'm clear."

"Outstanding." He clapped my shoulder hard enough to hurt. "Just like old times, right? The crew back together."

Except it wasn't like old times. Old times I'd been stupid enough to think the crew was family. That loyalty meant something. That guys like Snake actually cared about more than control and violence.

Now I knew better.

Now I was here anyway because the only thing worse than doing this was letting Amy pay for my mistakes.

We loaded into Snake's car—his Chevy was faster than my truck, less recognizable. I sat in back with J.T., crowbar heavy across my lap. Rico rode shotgun with the spray paint. Snake drove, relaxed and confident like we were heading to a drive-in instead of a felony.

Industrial Boulevard was dark and empty this time of night. Warehouses on both sides, chain-link fences, security lights casting yellow pools on the pavement. Snake killed the headlights and pulled into an alley behind a squat concrete building with "Chen Electronics Import/Export" painted on the side.

"This is it." Snake cut the engine. "Back door's around the corner. We pop it, get inside, work fast. Take the expensive stuff—computers, cameras, anything that looks valuable. Smash what we can't carry. Paint the walls. Ten minutes max, then we're gone."

My heart hammered against my ribs. This was really happening. I was really doing this.

"What if someone's inside?" I heard myself ask.

"Nobody's inside. I checked." Snake looked back at me. "You scared, Marcus?"

"No." Lie.

"Good. Because backing out now would be real stupid. Real disloyal." His smile didn't reach his eyes. "And we both know what happens to guys who aren't loyal."

The threat was clear. I was in this whether I wanted to be or not.

We got out of the car. The night was hot and still, no wind, just the distant sound of trucks on the highway. Rico led the way to the back door with J.T. behind him. I followed, feet feeling like lead.

Snake came last, knife in his hand now instead of hidden.

At the back door Rico jammed his crowbar into the frame and leaned his weight on it. Wood splintered. The door popped open with a crack that sounded like a gunshot in the quiet.

"Go, go," Snake hissed.

We went inside.

The warehouse was dark except for emergency exit signs casting red light across rows of shelving units stacked with boxes. Computers, televisions, stereos—thousands of dollars of electronics waiting to be shipped.

"Grab what you can carry," Snake ordered. "Marcus, you're with me. Rico, J.T., start loading."

I followed Snake deeper into the warehouse, crowbar hanging useless in my hand. My whole body felt wrong—adrenaline and shame mixing into something sick.

This was it. The moment I threw away my probation, my GED, my future. The moment I proved everyone right about guys like me never really changing.

All to protect a girl who'd begged me to trust her, to find another way, to not give up.

And I'd given up anyway.

"Marcus." Snake's voice was sharp. "Pay attention."

I blinked, focused. Snake was pointing at a stack of computer boxes.

"Grab those. Load them in the car."

I moved on autopilot, picking up boxes, carrying them back toward the exit. Rico and J.T. were already loading their arms with merchandise, faces tight with nervous energy.

This was wrong. Every part of this was wrong.

But I couldn't stop. Couldn't back out. Not with Snake's knife and threats and those photos of Amy hanging over my head.

I was trapped.

I carried the computers to the car, loaded them in the trunk. Went back for more. On my third trip Snake was spray-painting the walls—crude threats, crew symbols, the kind of vandalism that would make it clear this wasn't just robbery.

"Almost done," Snake said, shaking the can. "Few more minutes and we send our message."

That's when I heard it.

A door opening. Not the back door we'd broken through. The front entrance.

Footsteps.

Snake froze. We all froze.

"I thought you said nobody was here," J.T. hissed.

"Shut up." Snake moved toward the sound, knife ready.

A light switched on.

An older man in a security guard uniform stood at the front of the warehouse, hand on his radio, eyes wide as he took in the scene—four guys, crowbars, spray paint, merchandise scattered everywhere.

"Police are on their way," the guard said, voice shaking but firm. "You boys need to leave. Now."

Snake smiled. Started walking toward him.

"Snake, don't—" I started.

"Shut up, Marcus." Snake kept walking, knife visible now. "Old man, you got about five seconds to walk away and forget you saw anything."

The guard raised his radio. "I already called it in. They're coming."

In the distance, I heard sirens.

Snake cursed and bolted for the back door. Rico and J.T. ran after him. The guard yelled something I didn't catch.

I stood there for one frozen second, crowbar in my hand, stolen computers in the car outside, my entire future collapsing around me.

Running meant I was guilty.

Staying meant I'd get caught.

Either way, I'd lost.

I ran.

Out the back door into the alley. Snake's car was already gone—he'd abandoned us, left me and the others to scatter on our own. I sprinted for my truck, lungs burning, sirens getting louder.

Got the engine started on the second try. Pulled out of the alley without headlights, hands shaking so bad I could barely grip the wheel.

Two blocks away I saw the flash of police lights heading toward Industrial Boulevard. I turned the opposite direction, drove south through empty streets, every part of me screaming that I'd just destroyed everything.

The computers were in Snake's car. The spray paint had his fingerprints. But I'd been there. I'd helped. Security footage would show my face clear as day.

Officer Garrett's words echoed in my head: *If you participate in any criminal activity, you violate your probation. That means adult prison.*

I'd done it. Despite everything—despite Amy's faith in me, despite trying to go straight, despite knowing better—I'd walked right back into the life I'd been trying to escape.

And for what? To protect Amy from photos that might not even matter compared to this?

I drove home in the dark, the weight of what I'd done crushing down until I could barely breathe.

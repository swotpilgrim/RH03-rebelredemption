# Chapter 3: The Tutor

By the end of my second week, I'd fallen into a routine.

Show up at nine. Load the returns cart. Shelve books in order: fiction first, then non-fiction, then children's. Break down the empty boxes from new deliveries. Sweep the aisles if Donovan asked. Keep my head down, my mouth shut, and count the hours until I could leave.

The library patrons still watched me like I might pocket the silverware—not that libraries had silverware, but the principle stood. Mothers still steered their kids to different sections. The old men still looked up from their newspapers with suspicious eyes. But I'd learned to tune it out, to focus on the books and the work and the slowly shrinking number of hours between me and freedom.

One hundred and sixty-eight hours left. I was counting.

The rhythm of it wasn't terrible, if I was honest. There was something almost peaceful about the quiet, the order, the way books had their proper places and all you had to do was put them there. Nobody yelling. Nobody throwing punches. Nobody looking at you like you were supposed to be somebody you weren't.

Just me and the Dewey Decimal System and the smell of old paper.

Tuesday afternoon I noticed she was back.

Same table by the windows. Same neat cardigan—pale blue this time—and skirt, same pearl earrings catching the light. But a different student, a little girl maybe ten years old struggling with multiplication tables.

I tried not to watch. Failed.

She had this way of explaining things, patient and clear, never talking down to the kid but breaking concepts into pieces small enough to understand. When the girl got frustrated and threw her pencil down, the tutor just waited quietly until the girl picked it up again, then suggested they try a different approach.

I was shelving nearby—close enough to overhear without being obvious about it, or so I told myself.

"What if we think about it like counting groups?" she was saying. "You have three bags, and each bag has four apples. How many apples total?"

The girl frowned, counting on her fingers. "Twelve?"

"Exactly. That's three times four. See? You already know how to multiply. It's just counting groups."

The girl's face lit up with understanding, and the tutor smiled like the kid had just solved cold fusion.

I moved my cart before I got caught staring.

Thursday she was there again. Same time, two o'clock, this time with a teenage boy working through what looked like summer reading assignments. I kept my distance but found my cart routes taking me past her table more often than necessary.

Pathetic. That's what I was. Pathetic and stupid, mooning over some good girl who probably didn't know I existed beyond being that delinquent shelving books.

But I couldn't seem to stop.

Friday afternoon I was in the reference section, reaching for a high shelf to put back an encyclopedia volume, when I heard Mr. Donovan's voice from the next aisle over.

"Amy, could you help Mrs. Chen find that cookbook she requested?"

"Of course, Mr. Donovan."

Amy.

The name fit her somehow. Clean and simple and exactly the kind of name good girls from good families had.

"Thank you for staying late today," Donovan continued. "I know you have your regular tutoring students Tuesday and Thursday, but having you here on Fridays helps tremendously with the summer rush."

"I'm happy to help. I love it here."

Her voice was warm, genuine. She actually meant it—she loved volunteering at the library, loved tutoring kids, probably loved helping little old ladies find cookbooks. The kind of girl who did things because they were right, not because a judge ordered her to.

I stretched higher to reach the top shelf, focused on getting the encyclopedia in the right slot, and my sleeve rode up past my elbow.

The crew tattoo showed clear as day—coiled serpent wrapped around a switchblade, the ink still dark despite being two years old.

I heard footsteps and glanced down.

She was standing at the end of the aisle with a stack of books, looking up at me. Looking directly at my exposed forearm and the tattoo screaming exactly what I was.

Our eyes met.

I waited for the fear, the disgust, the quick retreat. Waited for her to clutch her books tighter and hurry away like every other respectable person in Riverside did when they got too close to Webb trouble.

Instead she just looked curious. Her gaze flicked from the tattoo to my face and back, and something in her expression was more like interest than judgment.

Then she gave a small smile—barely there, just a quirk at the corner of her mouth—before turning and walking toward the front desk with her books.

I yanked my sleeve down so fast I nearly dropped the encyclopedia.

Heat crawled up my neck and into my face. She'd seen. She'd seen the tattoo, seen exactly what I was, and she'd smiled. Like it didn't matter. Like I was just another person working in the library instead of a convicted criminal with gang ink marking him for life.

I shoved the encyclopedia onto the shelf and got out of that aisle before I could do something even stupider than blushing like a kid.

Four o'clock Friday. My shift ended and I headed for the door, desperate for the heat and noise of outside, for my truck and the drive home where I could stop feeling like I was under a microscope.

But I made the mistake of glancing back.

Amy was at the front desk, checking out books for a patron. As I watched, an older woman approached her—fifties maybe, with graying hair pinned up in an old-fashioned style and the kind of rigid posture that said she knew exactly who she was in the social order of Riverside.

The woman put her hand on Amy's shoulder with clear affection. Amy turned and smiled, said something I couldn't hear. The woman laughed.

Mother and daughter. Had to be. They had the same nose, the same way of holding themselves.

I pushed through the library door out into the June heat and stood on the marble steps for a second, processing.

Amy Parker.

Parker, as in Parker's Hardware Store on Main Street. The big three-story brick building that had been there since before the war, owned by the same family for generations. I'd been in there once with Danny to buy nails for a job, and the old man behind the counter—Amy's grandfather, probably—had watched us like we might rob him blind.

Right side of the tracks didn't even begin to cover it. The Parkers were Riverside royalty. Respectable, established, the kind of people who volunteered at libraries and sat in the good pews at church and sent their daughters to college.

And I was Marcus Webb from Oleander Street, with a crew tattoo and a criminal record and a future that probably looked a lot like my brother's.

I walked to my truck parked on the street and climbed in. Through the windshield I could see the library entrance. After a minute the door opened and Amy walked out with her mother. They descended the marble steps together, Mrs. Parker talking and Amy listening with that same patient attention she gave her tutoring students.

Mrs. Parker's eyes swept the street—part of that automatic surveillance people do in parking lots—and landed on me sitting in my truck.

Her expression went cold. Not quite disgust, but close enough. The look that said I see you and I know what you are and you don't belong here.

She said something to Amy, gesturing toward their car—a nice '56 Buick sedan, cream-colored with chrome that caught the sun. Amy glanced toward my truck. For a second I thought she might wave.

But she just followed her mother to their car.

I watched them drive away, Mrs. Parker behind the wheel, Amy in the passenger seat looking small and perfect in her cardigan and pearls.

Then I started my truck—third try, the engine coughing to life like it resented the effort—and headed south toward the tracks.

That night I couldn't stop thinking about her smile.

Not the polite one she gave her tutoring students or the warm one she gave her mother. The small, barely-there smile she'd given me when she saw my tattoo. Like she'd noticed something interesting instead of something shameful.

I lay in bed with the window open, trying to catch any breeze that might cut through the heat, and called myself every kind of fool.

Amy Parker was off-limits in every way that mattered. Different world, different life, different everything. She volunteered at libraries because she wanted to make the world better. I was there because a judge thought it might keep me out of jail.

She probably had college applications in the works, plans for a future that looked nothing like Riverside. Meanwhile I was a high school dropout with no prospects beyond maybe—maybe—not ending up in county lockup with Danny.

And her mother had looked at me like I was something stuck to the bottom of her shoe.

But that smile.

I punched my pillow and rolled over, trying to think about something else. Anything else.

One hundred and sixty hours to go. I could do one hundred and sixty hours without making an idiot of myself over some girl I'd never spoken to.

I had to.

Because the alternative—letting myself want something I could never have, someone I had no business even looking at—that way lay nothing but trouble.

And I'd had enough trouble for one lifetime.

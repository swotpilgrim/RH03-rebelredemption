# Chapter 6: Seeing Different

Thursday's session started the same as Tuesday's—me showing up at two with my notebook and a knot in my stomach, Amy already set up with her textbooks and that calm smile that said everything would be fine.

Except this time I wasn't quite as terrified.

"How are you doing?" she asked as I sat down.

"Good. Fine." I set my notebook on the table. "I worked through some of those reading strategies you showed me."

Her face lit up. "Really? That's great. Did they help?"

"I think so. Tried them on an article in the newspaper Mom brings home. Worked better than just reading straight through."

"Perfect. That's exactly what you should be doing—practicing with real-world material." She pulled a workbook toward her. "Today we're going to work on reading comprehension some more, then I want to start on basic essay structure."

We fell into a rhythm. Amy would explain a concept, I'd work through examples, she'd give feedback that was honest but never made me feel stupid. When I got frustrated with a particularly dense passage about the Industrial Revolution, she didn't push—just let me take a minute to breathe before trying again.

An hour in, I was staring at a comprehension passage that might as well have been written in another language. Something about themes in literature, asking me to identify symbolism and metaphor. The words blurred together.

"I don't get this," I said finally, shoving the paper away. "This analyzing stuff. It's just a story. Why does it matter what the author meant?"

Amy studied me for a moment. "Do you like reading?"

The question caught me off guard. "What?"

"Reading. For fun, not for tests. Do you like it?"

I shrugged. "Used to. When I was a kid."

"What did you read?"

Nobody had asked me that in years. Teachers assigned books from lists, and the crew sure as hell didn't sit around discussing literature. But Amy was looking at me with genuine curiosity, like my answer mattered.

"Adventure stuff mostly. Jack London. The dog ones—Call of the Wild, White Fang. Stories about survival and fighting and not giving up." The words came out before I could stop them. "I liked that the dogs had to be tough to make it, you know? That being strong mattered."

Amy's expression softened. "Buck is a great character. Have you read it recently?"

"Not since I was maybe twelve. Used to get books from this library, actually. Before..." I trailed off. Before everything went wrong. Before I became the kind of kid librarians watched instead of helped.

"Wait here." Amy stood and disappeared into the stacks.

I sat there confused, wondering if I'd said something wrong. But she was back in less than a minute holding a worn hardcover book.

"The Call of the Wild." She set it on the table in front of me. "I want you to read this before our next session."

I stared at the book. The cover showed Buck standing in snow, strong and defiant. I remembered loving that image as a kid.

"This isn't on the GED," I said.

"No. But you can't analyze literature if you hate reading, and you can't love reading if you're only doing it for tests." Amy slid the book closer. "Read this because you want to. Then we'll talk about it Tuesday. Not about symbolism—just what you thought."

"Why?"

She tilted her head, considering. "Because the point of education isn't just passing tests. It's about engaging with ideas, with stories, with things that matter. And I think this book matters to you."

Something about the way she said it—simple, direct, like it was obvious—made my throat tight.

"Okay," I managed.

"Besides," Amy added with a small smile, "if we're going to work together for months, you should actually enjoy some of it. School shouldn't only be suffering through things you hate."

The smile transformed her face. Not the polite one I'd seen her give library patrons or even the warm one she gave her tutoring students. This one was real, a little mischievous, like she was letting me in on a secret.

That maybe education could be about more than proving you weren't stupid.

After the session ended I walked out with the book under my arm, feeling oddly lighter than when I'd arrived.

Amy Parker had just given me homework that was reading a book I'd loved as a kid. Had said school shouldn't only be suffering. Had looked at me like I was a real student, not just a delinquent going through the motions.

In my truck I set the book on the passenger seat and stared at it.

When was the last time someone had given me something because they thought I'd enjoy it? Not because it was required or because they wanted something from me, but just because they'd listened when I talked and remembered what mattered?

I couldn't remember.

The book sat there on the worn vinyl, cover faded from years of other hands, and I felt something shift in my chest. Something that felt dangerously close to hope.

---

That night after Mom went to bed I opened the book.

The first line hit me like a punch: "Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble was brewing..."

I remembered this. Remembered being twelve and reading about Buck stolen from comfort and thrown into something brutal. How Buck had to fight, to survive in a world that didn't care about him.

Sounded familiar.

I read until past midnight. Buck learning the law of club and fang. Buck fighting Spitz for dominance. Buck discovering something wild that had always been there, waiting.

When I closed the book, I lay in the dark thinking about transformation. About becoming something harder, tougher, more yourself.

Was that what I was doing?

Maybe.

---

Friday my mind stayed on the book. Saturday I read more, sitting on the porch in the heat. Sunday morning I finished it.

Buck's final choice—to answer the call of the wild—hit harder than when I was twelve. Back then I thought it was about freedom. Now I saw it was about choosing who you wanted to be, even if that meant leaving comfort behind.

Even if it meant facing judgment from everyone who thought they knew you.

I set the book down and stared across the street at the railroad tracks visible between houses. North of those tracks was the library where Amy Parker spent her time teaching kids and volunteering and being everything good and respectable.

South of those tracks was me.

But twice a week I crossed those tracks and sat across from her, and she treated me like someone worth teaching. Like someone who could talk about Jack London and adventure and what stories meant.

Like someone who could be more than his worst mistakes.

Tuesday I worked through my shift in a daze, half my mind on what I'd say when Amy asked about the book.

Two o'clock came too fast and too slow.

I sat down and before Amy could pull out a textbook I said, "I finished it."

"The book?" Her eyes lit up. "Already?"

"Yeah. Saturday and Sunday. Couldn't really put it down."

"What did you think?"

What did I think? I thought about Buck choosing the wild. About transformation and survival and becoming who you were meant to be despite everything trying to keep you small and afraid.

But saying that out loud felt too vulnerable, too revealing.

"I liked that Buck didn't let them break him," I said instead. "Everyone wanted to use him or control him, but he stayed himself. Got tougher, sure, but he didn't let them make him weak."

Amy nodded slowly. "He adapted without losing his core self."

"Yeah. That." The words felt inadequate but true.

"Did you see the parallels?" She asked it gently, not pushing. "Between Buck's journey and other kinds of transformation?"

"Maybe." I met her eyes. "Buck had to become something different to survive. But he was still Buck underneath. Still himself."

"Exactly." Amy pulled her notebook closer. "That's analysis, Marcus. That's what English teachers mean when they ask about themes and meaning. You just did it naturally because you were engaged with the story."

I blinked. "That was analysis?"

"Yes. You identified a theme—maintaining identity through transformation—and supported it with evidence from the text." She smiled. "See? You're better at this than you think."

Something warm spread through my chest. I'd done literary analysis. Me, high school dropout Marcus Webb, had understood symbolism and themes just by actually caring about the story.

"Next time they ask you about themes," Amy continued, "just think about what the story made you feel or think about. What questions it raised. What the characters learned. That's all analysis is—engaging with the work on a deeper level than just plot."

She made it sound simple. Like education wasn't some impossible mountain but just a series of small steps that added up.

Like maybe I could actually do this.

The session flew by. We talked more about the book, then moved into an essay exercise where Amy asked me to write about Buck's transformation.

Buck started as a ranch dog who'd never known hardship. The Yukon changed him, made him harder and tougher. But he didn't become cruel or broken. He became more himself—discovered the wild part that had always been inside him. That's survival. Not just staying alive, but staying yourself even when everything tries to change you.

Amy read it and looked up with something like pride.

"This is good, Marcus. Really good. You have a strong voice and clear ideas. We'll work on structure and transitions, but the foundation is solid."

A strong voice. Clear ideas. Words I'd never heard applied to my work.

"Thank you," I said. "For the book. For... this."

"You did the work." She started gathering her materials. "I just pointed you toward something you'd connect with. That's what good teaching is."

As I walked to my truck that afternoon, I realized something had shifted.

Amy Parker wasn't just my tutor.

She was someone who saw me—really saw me—and thought I was worth the effort.

And that was dangerous, because I was starting to care what she thought. Starting to want to be the person she seemed to believe I could be.

Starting to fall for a girl who was absolutely, completely off-limits.

But as I drove home, Buck's story running through my head, I couldn't quite bring myself to care about the danger.

For the first time in years, I felt like I was becoming someone worth being.

And Amy Parker had been the one to show me how.

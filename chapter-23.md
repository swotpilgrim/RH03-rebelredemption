# Chapter 23: Consequences and Clarity

We sat at the kitchen table, Sunday morning sun streaming through the window like everything was normal. Like my world wasn't ending.

I told Mom everything. Started with Snake showing up in the alley behind the library, threatening to destroy Amy's future if I didn't help with the job. Told her about trying to talk to Garrett, about the system offering no help, about feeling trapped with no good choices.

Told her about Saturday night. The depot, the warehouse, Snake turning a simple theft into something violent. The guard, the alarm, running.

Mom listened without interrupting. Her face showed exhaustion and worry but not surprise. Like she'd been waiting for this moment since Danny got arrested, since the day I first came home with crew ink on my arm.

When I finished she was quiet for a long time.

"Are you hurt?" she finally asked.

The question surprised me. Of everything she could have asked—why didn't you tell me, how could you be so stupid, what were you thinking—she asked if I was hurt.

"No," I said. "I'm not hurt."

"Did you hurt anyone? That guard, the other boys?"

"No. We ran when the alarm went off. Nobody got hurt."

"Good." She touched my hand across the table. "That's good, Marcus."

I stared at her, not understanding. "Mom, I broke into a building. I helped Snake and his crew commit a crime. I violated my probation. How is any of that good?"

"It's not." Her voice was steady, matter-of-fact. "You made terrible choices. But nobody got hurt, you didn't use violence, and you're sitting here telling me the truth instead of running or lying." She squeezed my hand. "That's something."

"Something that's sending me to prison."

"Maybe." She said it calmly, like we were discussing weather. "Probably. But prison or not, you have choices about how you handle this. About what kind of person you want to be moving forward."

I pulled my hand away, frustration rising. "What kind of choices? Garrett gave me forty-eight hours to turn myself in. Two days and then I'm in cuffs. Where's the choice in that?"

"You can run," Mom said. "Leave Riverside, try to disappear. Plenty of boys do that when they're looking at hard time."

"You want me to run?"

"No." Her voice was firm. "I want you to face it. But I'm saying you have a choice. You always have a choice, even when the options all look bad."

I slumped in my chair. "What's the point of facing it? The security footage shows me clear as day. I'm going to prison no matter what."

"Then you go to prison having done the right thing at the end." Mom stood, walked to the sink. "When they took your brother, he fought it every step. Lied to the cops, tried to pin it on someone else. The judge threw the book at him because Danny showed no responsibility, no remorse."

She turned back. "You don't have to be like Danny. You can face your consequences head-on. Tell the truth. It might not save you from prison, but it'll save you from becoming the kind of man who runs his whole life."

"I was trying to protect Amy," I said quietly. "Snake was going to destroy her reputation. I thought if I did this one job he'd leave her alone."

"And did he? Did doing the job protect Amy?"

I thought about Amy's missed calls. About how the whole town would soon know Marcus Webb got arrested for burglary.

"No," I admitted. "It made everything worse."

"Because you tried to protect her by lying and hiding and making decisions alone." Mom's voice was gentle but firm. "Same way you've been trying to protect everyone—me, Amy, yourself—by not trusting anyone to help carry the weight."

"The system wouldn't help. Garrett said—"

"I know what Garrett said. I know the system doesn't work fair for boys like you." She came back to the table, sat down across from me. "But you didn't go back to Amy after Garrett failed you. Didn't tell her it didn't work and ask what to do next. You just gave up and did what Snake wanted."

The words hit hard because they were true.

"She told me to break the cycle," I said. "To stand up to Snake instead of giving in. But I was too scared of what he'd do to her."

"And now what's he going to do to her when the whole town knows she's been spending time with a boy who violated probation?"

I put my head in my hands. "I know. I know I messed up. I was trying to do the right thing—"

"You were trying to do the easy thing," Mom corrected. "The right thing would have been trusting the people who care about you. Telling Amy what happened with Garrett. Working together to find another way. Maybe it would have failed anyway, but at least you wouldn't be sitting here having made it worse by trying to handle it alone."

I couldn't argue with that. Couldn't defend choices I knew were wrong even when I was making them.

"So what do I do now?" I asked. Voice small.

"Now you face it." Mom's voice was steady. "Turn yourself in Monday morning. Tell the truth about Snake threatening you—all of it. Take responsibility but make it clear you were coerced. Let a lawyer sort out what that means."

"It won't matter. I still broke the law."

"Maybe. But the truth matters anyway. Facing consequences matters." She reached across and tilted my chin up. "You made mistakes, baby. Bad ones. But how you handle what comes next—that's what shows who you really are."

Tears burned behind my eyes. "I'm scared, Mom."

"I know." Her own eyes were wet. "But if you do go to prison, you go knowing you told the truth at the end. That you took responsibility." She squeezed my hand. "That's all any of us can do."

We sat there in silence for a while, holding hands across the table while the sun climbed higher and the day stretched out ahead.

Finally Mom said, "You need to talk to Amy."

My stomach twisted. "I can't."

"You can and you will." Her voice left no room for argument. "That girl has been calling you. She deserves to know what happened. Deserves to hear it from you instead of town gossip."

"She's going to hate me."

"Maybe. Or maybe she'll understand you were scared and stupid and trying to protect her the wrong way." Mom stood up. "Either way, she deserves the truth. And you deserve to face her instead of hiding."

"What do I even say?"

"Start with sorry. Then tell her everything, same as you told me. Let her decide how she feels about it." Mom touched my shoulder. "You can't control how people react to your mistakes, Marcus. You can only control whether you're honest about making them."

I nodded, throat too tight to speak.

"I'm going to try to get some sleep," Mom said. "I have another shift tonight. You should rest too. Monday's going to be a hard day."

She kissed the top of my head like she used to when I was little, then went to her room.

I sat alone at the kitchen table with my phone in my hand and Amy's missed calls glowing on the screen.

Mom was right. Amy deserved the truth.

But calling her meant admitting everything. Meant facing her disappointment. Meant watching the faith she had in me crumble when she realized I'd done exactly what she'd begged me not to do.

It meant being honest when lying would be so much easier.

My phone buzzed. Another call from Amy.

This time I answered.

"Marcus?" Her voice was worried, urgent. "Oh thank God. I've been trying to reach you all morning. Are you okay?"

"No," I said honestly. "I'm not okay."

"What happened? You disappeared after Thursday and you haven't answered my calls and I've been so worried—"

"Amy." I cut her off gently. "I need to tell you something. But I need you to just listen until I'm done, okay?"

Silence. Then, quietly: "Okay."

So I told her. About Thursday with Garrett, how the system wouldn't help. About feeling trapped with no way to protect her except doing what Snake wanted. About Saturday night, the warehouse, the alarm.

About getting caught on camera.

About having forty-eight hours before I had to turn myself in.

I told her everything while staring at the kitchen table, unable to look up, unable to face even the idea of her expression.

When I finished there was silence on the other end. Long, awful silence.

"Amy?" I said finally.

"You did it anyway." Her voice was flat, shock and hurt mixed together. "After everything we talked about. After I begged you to trust me, to find another way. You did it anyway."

"I was trying to protect you—"

"No." The word was sharp. "You were protecting yourself from having to trust me. From having to believe I could handle hard things. You decided my reputation mattered more than actually trusting me to make my own choices."

"Snake had photos. He was going to destroy your college applications—"

"And now being associated with someone who violated probation will destroy them anyway!" Her voice rose. "Don't you see? You didn't protect me, Marcus. You just made it worse by not trusting me enough to face it together."

I couldn't speak. Couldn't defend myself because she was right.

"I have to go," Amy said quietly. "I need to think."

"Amy, please—"

The line went dead.

I sat there with the phone in my hand, staring at the ended call, feeling like I'd just lost the one good thing in my life.

Mom's words echoed: *You can only control whether you're honest about making them.*

I'd been honest. I'd told Amy the truth.

And she'd hung up on me.

Maybe honesty wasn't enough.

Maybe some mistakes were too big to come back from.

I put my head down on the table and let the weight of everything crush me.

Forty-eight hours until I turned myself in.

Forty-eight hours of freedom left.

And I'd spend them alone, having lost everyone who mattered by trying too hard to protect them.

Maybe that was fitting.

Maybe that was exactly what I deserved.

# Chapter 9: Dangerous Territory

Six weeks.

I'd been showing up at the Riverside Public Library for six weeks. One hundred hours of my community service completed, one hundred to go. Halfway through my sentence, and according to Officer Garrett's weekly check-in, I was actually complying for once.

"Haven't had a single complaint about you," Garrett said Thursday morning, reviewing my paperwork in his cramped office at the county building. "Donovan says you're on time, do your work, no problems. That true?"

"Yes, sir."

He studied me with eyes that had seen too many kids make promises they didn't keep. "How's the GED tutoring?"

"Good. Making progress."

"You planning to actually take the test?"

The question shouldn't have stung, but it did. "Yes, sir."

"Hmm." He made a note. "Well. Keep it up. Four more months and you'll be done with this. Don't screw it up now."

"No, sir."

I left his office feeling the weight of skepticism. Garrett expected me to fail—they all did. It was just a matter of when, not if.

But I'd been clean for six weeks. No crew contact, no trouble, just work and tutoring and trying to be someone different.

Someone better.

Someone worthy of the way Amy smiled when I got a concept right.

Thursday afternoon, two o'clock. Our session.

Amy and I had been working on algebra for the past week—equations and variables that made my brain hurt but were starting to make sense. She had a way of explaining math like it was a puzzle instead of torture, breaking problems into smaller pieces until they stopped looking impossible.

"So if X equals three, what does this whole equation equal?" She pointed at the problem I'd been working through.

I did the math in my head, substituted the value, worked through the operations. "Fifteen?"

"Exactly." She smiled—that real smile that made my chest feel too small. "You're getting really good at this."

"I have a good teacher."

She ducked her head, but I caught the pleased look on her face before she turned to grab another worksheet.

We were bent over the same textbook, heads close together while she pointed out where I'd made a small error, when I heard footsteps approaching.

"Amy."

We both looked up.

Mrs. Parker stood three feet from our table, purse clutched in front of her like armor, her expression cold enough to freeze California in July.

"Mom." Amy straightened. "You're early. We're not done yet—"

"I can see that." Mrs. Parker's eyes flicked to me, then away, like looking at me too long might contaminate her. "We need to go. Now."

"But I have twenty minutes left in our session."

"Now, Amy."

The words weren't loud but they carried weight. Authority. The kind of parental command that didn't allow for argument.

Amy's jaw tightened. She started gathering her materials slowly, deliberately, and I recognized the small rebellion in it. Making her mother wait while she took her time organizing textbooks and papers.

"Same time Tuesday?" she asked me, voice steady despite the tension radiating from her mother.

"Yeah," I managed.

Mrs. Parker made a small sound of disapproval. Amy's eyes flashed but she didn't respond, just picked up her stack of materials and walked toward the exit with her mother following.

I watched them go.

Through the tall library windows I could see them cross to their Buick parked on Main Street. Mrs. Parker got in the driver's side. Amy sat in the passenger seat. And then they were having a conversation—Mrs. Parker's hands moving sharply, Amy's posture defensive, both of them clearly arguing about something.

About me.

It didn't take a genius to figure out what Mrs. Parker was saying. The Webb boy. The criminal. The gang member with a record who had no business being anywhere near her daughter, much less sitting close enough to touch while working through algebra problems.

She was right, of course. I didn't have any business being near Amy. Didn't have any business letting myself care about her, look forward to our sessions, fall for her patient smile and quiet strength.

But I was in too deep to stop now.

I gathered my notebook and headed back to finish my shift, trying not to think about how long it would take Mrs. Parker to convince Amy that tutoring me wasn't worth the trouble.

Friday afternoon I was cleaning up after my shift when I stepped out the library's back entrance to take trash to the dumpster.

Snake Morrison was leaning against my truck.

Every muscle in my body tensed. I hadn't seen Snake since that day months ago when he'd shown up at my house making threats. Had hoped I wouldn't see him again. Had been stupid enough to think maybe the crew had forgotten about me.

"Marcus." Snake smiled, all easy charm that didn't reach his eyes. "Long time."

I set the trash bag down carefully, keeping my hands visible and loose. "Snake."

"You've been hard to find lately. Don't come around the depot anymore. Don't answer when the guys try to reach out." He pushed off my truck, taking a step closer. "Starting to feel like you're avoiding us."

"Been busy."

"Right. Library service." His smile widened. "Heard you're working for the man now. Shelving books, playing nice with the respectable folks. That true?"

"I'm doing my community service. That's all."

"That all?" Snake circled slowly, hands in his pockets, deceptively relaxed. I knew better. Had seen him go from calm to violent in half a second too many times to be fooled. "Because word is you're doing more than shelving books. Got yourself a little tutor. Pretty girl from the right side of town. That's a step up for a Webb."

Heat flooded my face. "Don't."

"Don't what? Notice that you're spending time with Amy Parker?" Snake's voice carried an edge now. "Everyone's noticed, Marcus. Small town. People talk. They're wondering what a good girl like that is doing with crew trash like you."

"I'm not crew anymore."

The words came out before I could stop them.

Snake went still. "What?"

"You heard me. I'm done with that life. Done with the depot, done with the jobs, done with all of it."

Snake stared at me. Then laughed—short and humorless.

"You don't get to be done, Marcus. The crew isn't something you quit. We're family. We took care of you when nobody else gave a damn."

"Danny's in jail because of that family."

"Danny got sloppy. That's on him." Snake moved closer, into my space. "But you think you can just walk away? Be somebody different because you're reading books with some pretty girl?"

"Yeah."

Snake's expression hardened. "You're soft. Always were. Now you're proving it, running to libraries instead of standing with your real family."

"The crew isn't family. You use people until they stop being useful."

"Let me tell you what family is. Family had your back when you were fifteen and lost. Family taught you to fight, to be somebody. Family doesn't betray that."

"I'm not betraying anyone. I'm trying to stay out of jail."

"By turning your back on the people who made you?" Snake shook his head. "That's betrayal, Marcus. And the crew doesn't forget."

My heart pounded but I kept my voice steady. "What do you want?"

"I want you to remember where you came from. Remember you got responsibilities." He smiled, cold. "The crew needs help with a job next week. Easy work. Like old times."

"No."

"No?" Snake's eyebrows rose. "You saying no to me?"

"I'm saying no to jobs. To the crew. To all of it. I told you—I'm done."

Snake studied me for a long moment. Then he pulled his hands from his pockets and spread them wide. "Okay. You want to be done? Fine. But let me ask you something. Your mom still working late shifts at the cannery? Third shift, gets off around midnight?"

Ice ran down my spine. "Don't."

"Don't what? Ask about your family? Rita Webb, good woman, works herself to death trying to keep you and Danny fed. Be a real shame if something happened to her. Walking to her car alone in that dark parking lot. Lot of things can happen in the dark."

Rage and fear mixed into something toxic. "You touch her—"

"I'm not threatening anyone." Snake's voice was all innocence. "Just pointing out that when you turn your back on people who care, bad things can happen. Protection isn't free. Walking away from the crew means walking away from protection."

"You son of a—"

"Easy." Snake held up his hands. "I'm just talking. Reminding you that choices have consequences. You can keep playing library helper. But the crew remembers. And we take care of our own—even when they forget to take care of us."

He stepped back, that cold smile still in place.

"Think about it, Marcus. We got a job next week. Could use your help. Would mean a lot to see you there. Would mean the crew knows you still got loyalty. Would mean your mom sleeps safer at night."

He walked away, leaving me standing in the alley with trash at my feet and terror in my gut.

I couldn't go home. Couldn't face Mom knowing Snake had just threatened her because I tried to walk away.

I drove. No destination, just movement while my mind raced.

Snake was using the only leverage that would work—Mom. He knew I didn't care what happened to me. But threatening her was different.

That made it personal.

I could refuse the job. Stay clean, finish my service, get my GED. Build the life Amy thought I was capable of having.

But if something happened to Mom because I wouldn't play along?

I'd never forgive myself.

An hour later I ended up at the depot without meaning to. Muscle memory. Years of driving here when I had nowhere else to go.

The building was empty in the late light. Broken windows and graffiti that had once felt like home now just looked like what they were: a place where kids with no future wasted time and called it belonging.

The crew wasn't family. They'd given me somewhere to belong when I was fifteen and lost. But they'd also dragged me into fights and theft and choices that nearly destroyed any chance I had at a real life.

Walking away was the right thing to do.

But the right thing might cost Mom everything.

Night was falling when I drove home. Mom's car wasn't there—still at work, wouldn't be home until after midnight.

Walking alone through that dark parking lot.

I sat on the porch and waited, watching the street, jumping at every sound.

Snake had made his move.

Now I had to figure out how to protect the people I loved without destroying the life I was trying to build.

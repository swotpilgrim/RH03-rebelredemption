# Chapter 28: Six Months Later

February morning, cold and gray. I walked out of Riverside County Jail with a garbage bag full of my belongings and a GED certificate folded in my pocket.

Six months. It had felt like years.

Mom was waiting in the parking lot, leaning against her car. When she saw me she straightened up, and for a second I thought she might cry. But she just opened the passenger door and said, "Let's go home, baby."

We drove through Riverside in silence. Everything looked the same—Main Street with its hardware stores and diners, the railroad tracks cutting through town, the library on the corner. Like the world had frozen while I was locked up.

But I knew that wasn't true. Six months was a long time. Things had changed, even if the buildings hadn't.

"Your room's clean," Mom said as we pulled into our driveway. "I washed the sheets yesterday."

"Thanks."

"You hungry?"

"Yeah. But first I want to—" I gestured vaguely. "Shower. Change. Just... be home."

She nodded. "Take your time."

Inside the house felt smaller than I remembered. I stood in the living room looking at everything—Danny's photo on the wall, the couch I'd sat on that Sunday morning waiting for Garrett, the kitchen table where Mom and I had talked about facing consequences.

It felt like a lifetime ago.

In the bathroom I locked the door—actually locked it, because I could—and turned on the shower. Stood under the hot water for twenty minutes, washing away six months of county jail soap and fluorescent lighting.

In my room I found clean clothes laid out on the bed. Jeans that actually fit, a t-shirt that smelled like home instead of industrial detergent. I got dressed slowly, relearning the feeling of fabric that was mine, not issued.

When I came out Mom had made breakfast. Eggs, toast, coffee. Real coffee, not the weak institutional stuff.

We ate in comfortable silence.

"You got plans?" she finally asked.

"Library," I said. "Mr. Donovan said I could come back if I wanted. Still got community service hours to finish."

"And after that?"

I pulled the GED certificate from my pocket, unfolded it. "After that I figure out what comes next. Donovan mentioned college prep programs. Might look into that."

Mom's hand covered mine. "I'm proud of you. You know that?"

"I know."

"You did your time. Kept your head down. Got your GED. That takes strength, Marcus."

"Or stubbornness." I tried to smile. "Webb family trait."

She squeezed my hand. "You're not like Danny. You came back from this. He never did."

The words sat heavy between us—the truth we'd both been dancing around. Danny had let prison harden him. I'd tried to let it teach me.

"I gotta check in with my probation officer today," I said. "Then library tomorrow if Donovan still wants me."

"He does. Called last week to confirm." Mom cleared our plates. "You got restrictions?"

"Curfew. Weekly check-ins. Can't associate with known gang members. Have to maintain employment or education." I recited the list from memory. "Standard supervised probation for the next two years."

"You'll do fine," she said. "You're good at following rules when you want to."

I hoped she was right.

Wednesday morning I drove to the library in the same beat-up truck I'd driven six months ago. It started on the second try, same as always.

The parking lot was mostly empty—weekday morning, not many patrons yet. I sat in the truck for a minute, gathering courage.

Six months ago I'd walked out of here in handcuffs. Now I was walking back in trying to prove I'd learned something from the whole disaster.

Mr. Donovan was at the front desk sorting returns when I came through the doors. He looked up, nodded once like I'd just been gone for lunch, and said, "Cart's in back. History section needs restocking."

No speech. No welcome back. Just work.

I'd never been so grateful for normal in my life.

"Yes, sir."

The library felt exactly the same—same smell of old books and furniture polish, same creak in the history section floorboards, same afternoon light through the tall windows. Like I'd stepped back in time.

But I wasn't the same. Six months had changed me in ways I was still figuring out.

I worked through the morning shelving books, reorganizing displays, helping patrons find materials. The familiar rhythm settled something restless in my chest. This place had given me a chance before. Was giving me another one now.

At noon I was in the stacks, arms full of biographies, when I felt someone watching.

I turned around.

Amy stood at the end of the aisle.

My heart stopped.

She looked different. Older somehow, though only six months had passed. Her hair was shorter, just past her shoulders instead of down her back. She wore jeans and a college sweatshirt—Riverside Community College in blue letters.

But her eyes were the same. Warm and brown and looking at me like I was worth seeing.

"Hi," she said.

The word hit me like a punch. Casual, like no time had passed. Like the last six months hadn't happened.

"Hi," I managed. Voice rough, throat tight.

She walked closer, slow and careful. "Donovan said you were coming back this week. Thought I'd stop by."

"You're home from school?"

"Winter break." She stopped a few feet away, maintaining distance. "First semester just ended. I'm home until February."

"How was it? College?"

"Good. Hard. Different." A small smile. "Made some friends. Joined the education club. Survived my first finals."

"That's great." I meant it. Wanted to hear everything—every detail of the life she'd been living while I was locked up. But couldn't find the words.

Silence stretched between us, awkward and loaded.

"You look good," Amy finally said. "Different. But good."

"Thanks. So do you."

More silence.

"Marcus—"

"Amy—"

We both spoke at once, stopped, almost smiled.

"You first," I said.

She took a breath. "I know we said we'd wait. That we'd see how things went. But six months is a long time and I don't—I don't know where we stand. If we stand anywhere. I wrote you letters but you never wrote back and I didn't know if that meant you'd changed your mind or—"

"I couldn't write back," I interrupted. "Protective custody. No mail privileges except legal correspondence. I wanted to—I read every letter you sent, Amy. Kept them all. But I couldn't respond."

Her expression shifted. "Oh. I didn't—they didn't tell me that."

"Probably should have had my lawyer explain. Sorry."

"No, I'm sorry. I should have realized." She bit her lip. "Did you really read them? All of them?"

"Every word. Some of them multiple times." I set down the books I was holding. "You wrote about your classes. Your new friend Jessica. The education professor who reminds you of Mr. Donovan. The campus bookstore cat named Fitzgerald."

Amy's eyes went bright. "You remember all that?"

"I didn't have much else to do except work and read your letters." I shoved my hands in my pockets to keep from reaching for her. "They kept me sane in there. Reminded me there was a world outside worth coming back to."

"Marcus." Her voice was soft, careful. "What do you want? Now that you're out. What do you want from... this?"

The question I'd been asking myself for six months.

I looked at her standing there—smart and strong and so far out of my league it hurt. She'd waited. Had written letters. Had thought about me enough to come see me today.

But six months was a long time. She had a whole new life at college. New friends, new experiences, a future that didn't include a guy on probation with a criminal record.

I should tell her I was fine. That she should go live her life without looking back. That I'd be okay.

But I'd spent six months learning to be honest. To stop deciding things alone. To trust people when they said they cared.

"I want another chance," I said. Voice raw but steady. "I want to prove I learned something in there. That I can be honest and trust you and not screw everything up." I met her eyes. "I want you, Amy. If you'll still have me. But I'll understand if you've moved on."

She was quiet for a long moment. Then she closed the distance between us and took my hand.

"I haven't moved on," she said. "But I need you to understand—I'm not the same girl who testified for you six months ago. I've grown. Changed. Figured out who I am separate from what people expect."

"I know."

"And you're not the same guy who went in."

"No. I'm not."

"So maybe we start over," Amy said. "Not pretending the past didn't happen. But building something new with who we are now instead of who we were then."

"I'd like that." I squeezed her hand gently. "Fresh start. No more secrets. No more protecting you by shutting you out."

"Deal." She smiled, real and bright. "So. Marcus Webb. Tell me about the last six months. And I don't mean the highlights—I want the real story."

I laughed, surprising myself. "Okay. But it's not pretty."

"I didn't ask for pretty. I asked for real."

"Fair enough."

We sat down at one of the library tables—the same one we'd used for tutoring sessions months ago. And I told her everything. The boredom and fear and monotony of county jail. Getting my GED. The guys I'd met inside. The things I'd learned about myself.

She listened without interrupting, asking questions, treating my story like it mattered.

And when I finished she told me about college. About struggling with her first English paper. About missing Riverside and being relieved to leave it. About writing letters to me and wondering if I'd still want her when you got out.

We talked until Mr. Donovan appeared and pointedly said the history section wasn't going to shelve itself.

Amy laughed and stood. "I should let you work."

"Yeah. Sorry."

"Don't be." She touched my arm briefly. "Coffee tomorrow? Actually talk instead of sneaking conversations between shelving?"

"I'd like that. I have probation check-in at nine, but after?"

"After works. There's a new place on Elm Street. Ten-thirty?"

"I'll be there."

She smiled, turned to leave, then looked back. "Marcus? I'm glad you're home."

"Me too."

She left. I went back to shelving books.

But everything felt different now. Lighter. Like the weight I'd been carrying for six months had finally started to lift.

I had a long road ahead—probation, finding real work, figuring out college. Proving to everyone who'd vouched for me that their faith was justified.

But I wasn't alone anymore.

And that made all the difference.

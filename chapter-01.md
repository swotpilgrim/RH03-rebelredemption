# Chapter 1: Wrong Side of the Tracks

The courtroom smelled like floor wax and fear.

I'd been in enough trouble to recognize both. Judge Harrison sat behind his bench like some kind of Old Testament prophet ready to hand down judgment, and I stood there in the one button-down shirt I owned that didn't have holes, trying to look like I gave a damn about my future. The shirt was too tight across the shoulders—hadn't fit right since I was sixteen and Danny bought it for me from the Goodwill. Two years of working construction jobs and throwing punches had changed my body. Two years of running with the Riverside Crew had changed everything else.

My court-appointed lawyer stood beside me smelling like cheap aftershave and cheaper cigarettes. He'd told me this morning to keep my mouth shut and look remorseful. Remorseful I could manage. It was hope I couldn't quite pull off.

"Mr. Webb." Judge Harrison's voice cut through the courtroom quiet. "Do you understand the severity of your situation?"

"Yes, sir." The words came out rougher than I intended.

He studied me over his reading glasses, probably seeing the same thing everyone in Riverside saw when they looked at Marcus Webb: trouble waiting to happen. Greased-back hair, leather jacket I'd worn despite my lawyer's advice to ditch it, the hardness around my eyes that comes from learning too young that the world doesn't give second chances to kids from south of the railroad tracks.

"You turned eighteen last month," Harrison continued. "Which means this court has options we didn't have when you were a juvenile. Adult options. Adult consequences."

My gut clenched but I kept my face blank. The Riverside Crew had taught me that much—never let them see you scared.

"Your record shows a pattern of poor decisions." Harrison shuffled papers. "Association with known gang members. Theft. Assault charges, though those were dropped. You've been in my courtroom three times in two years, Mr. Webb. Each time you've received leniency based on your age and family circumstances."

He paused, and the silence stretched like wire pulled too tight.

"I won't get into the particulars of your family situation. I'm aware your older brother is currently serving time. I'm aware your mother works double shifts trying to keep you out of the trouble you seem determined to find."

Hearing him mention Mom made my jaw clench. Rita Webb had enough to deal with without judges throwing her exhaustion in my face.

My lawyer cleared his throat. "Your Honor, if I may. Marcus has no violent offenses on his adult record. He's demonstrated willingness to comply with previous court orders. We'd like to request community service in lieu of incarceration."

Harrison's eyebrows rose. "Community service."

"Yes, Your Honor. Marcus dropped out of school at sixteen, but he's expressed interest in obtaining his GED. Community service at an educational institution could provide both punishment and opportunity."

I hadn't expressed anything of the sort, but I wasn't about to argue if it kept me out of county jail.

The judge studied me for what felt like an hour. I forced myself to meet his eyes, to not look away like some guilty kid. I was guilty—guilty as hell of every stupid thing I'd done in the past two years. But looking away wouldn't change that.

"Two hundred hours of community service," Harrison finally said. "At the Riverside Public Library. You'll report to Mr. Albert Donovan, the head librarian, who has agreed to supervise your service. You'll also maintain weekly check-ins with a probation officer. Zero tolerance, Mr. Webb. One violation, one complaint, one missed check-in, and you'll be right back in this courtroom facing adult incarceration. Do you understand?"

"Yes, sir."

"I hope you do. You're eighteen now. Old enough to make better choices. Old enough to face adult consequences if you don't." He banged his gavel. "Next case."

And just like that, my future was decided.

Mom drove me home in her battered '52 Chevy, the silence between us heavier than the June heat pouring through the open windows. The air conditioning had died last summer and we couldn't afford to fix it. Same as we couldn't afford to fix most things.

Riverside spread out around us in that particular California way—flat and hot and dusty, citrus groves giving way to the downtown strip, then the railroad tracks cutting through like a scar. North of the tracks was where the respectable people lived. The Parkers with their hardware store. The Johnsons who ran the bank. Nice houses with painted shutters and grass that stayed green even in summer.

South of the tracks was us.

Our rental house sat on Oleander Street, a tired collection of small homes with peeling paint and yards more dirt than grass. Mom pulled into the driveway and killed the engine. For a moment we just sat there, heat radiating off the dashboard, neither of us knowing what to say.

"Don't make me bury another son, Marcus."

The words hit like a fist to the gut. She didn't look at me when she said it, just stared straight ahead at our house with its broken porch step I kept meaning to fix.

"I won't, Mama."

"Danny said the same thing." Her voice was flat, scraped raw by too many disappointments. "Right up until they put handcuffs on him."

She got out of the car and headed inside, leaving me sitting in the passenger seat with her words ringing in my ears.

---

Inside, the house was dim and stuffy. Mom had the shades drawn against the heat. I went to my room—barely big enough for a bed and a dresser, with water stains on the ceiling from when the roof leaked last winter. Across the hall, Danny's door stood closed.

I pushed it open.

Danny's room looked like he'd just stepped out for a smoke. Bed made military-tight the way he liked it. Hot rod magazines stacked on the nightstand. The poster of James Dean from "Rebel Without a Cause" still tacked to the wall, edges curling from the heat. For two years Danny had been my hero—tough, fearless, somebody who didn't take crap from anyone. He'd gotten me into the Riverside Crew when I was fifteen and lost, given me somewhere to belong when school felt like a prison and home felt like a reminder of everything we didn't have.

Now Danny was in county jail doing two years for auto theft, and I was one judge's decision away from joining him.

I sat on his bed, springs creaking under my weight. The crew tattoo on my left forearm caught my eye—rough ink done in Snake Morrison's garage when I was sixteen, still proud and stupid enough to think marking myself for life was some kind of honor. The design was simple: a coiled serpent wrapped around a switchblade. Riverside Crew. Family forever.

Except family was supposed to protect you, not drag you down.

I'd worn long sleeves to court to hide it. Would probably wear long sleeves the rest of my life, carrying this stupid decision on my skin.

Two hundred hours at the library. It felt like a joke. Marcus Webb, high school dropout and convicted delinquent, shelving books for little kids and old ladies. Judge Harrison probably thought he was giving me an opportunity. What he'd really given me was two hundred hours of being stared at, judged, reminded that guys like me don't belong in places like libraries.

But it beat jail.

That night I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, listening to the sounds of Riverside at night—dogs barking, the distant whistle of a freight train, somebody's radio playing Buddy Holly through an open window. Tomorrow I'd have to show up at the library at nine o'clock sharp, wear my shame like the leather jacket nobody could make me take off, and start paying my debt to a society that had written me off years ago.

Sleep didn't come easy.

Morning arrived too fast and too hot. I showered, pulled on jeans and a white t-shirt, grabbed the leather jacket. Mom was already gone—early shift at the cannery started at six. She'd left coffee in the pot, which was her version of encouragement.

My truck sat in the driveway looking as beat-up as I felt. Danny had left me his '51 Ford pickup when he went in—primer gray, engine that turned over on the third try if you were lucky, bench seat with springs poking through the vinyl. But it was mine, and in Riverside your car mattered almost as much as your reputation.

I coaxed the engine to life and headed toward Main Street.

The library sat right in the heart of respectable Riverside, north of the tracks where I didn't belong. It was one of those old Carnegie buildings from before the First World War—marble steps worn smooth by decades of feet, tall windows, the kind of place that demanded you whisper and watch your manners. I parked on the street, killed the engine, and sat there for a minute gathering whatever passed for courage.

Through the windshield I could see people walking past. Mothers with kids. Old men with newspapers. Normal people living normal lives who'd probably cross the street if they saw me coming.

I thought about Danny behind bars. About Mom's voice saying she couldn't bury another son. About Judge Harrison's warning that one mistake would put me in adult prison.

Then I got out of the truck, pulled on my jacket despite the heat, and climbed those marble steps to start serving my time.

The heavy door swung open into cool, quiet air that smelled like old paper and furniture polish. A woman at the front desk looked up, saw me, and her welcoming smile flickered out like a candle in wind.

Two hundred hours. I could survive two hundred hours of anything.

I had to.

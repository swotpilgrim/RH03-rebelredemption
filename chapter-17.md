# Chapter 17: Pulling Away

I sat in my truck outside the library Thursday evening, engine off, phone in my hand. The sun was setting, turning the sky orange and pink over Main Street. Inside, Amy would be waiting at our usual table, books spread out, wondering where I was.

My thumb hovered over the keyboard. I'd typed and deleted three different messages already.

Finally I just wrote: *Can't make it tonight. Helping my mom with something. Sorry.*

It was a lie. Mom was at the cannery working her usual shift. I was sitting here in the parking lot like a coward, unable to face Amy knowing what Snake had threatened.

I hit send before I could change my mind.

The response came less than a minute later: *Is everything okay?*

No. Nothing was okay. Snake had me trapped. Friday deadline was tomorrow and I still didn't know what to do.

*Fine. Just busy. See you next week.*

I turned off my phone before she could respond and started the truck. The engine coughed twice before catching, and I drove home south of the tracks to my empty house.

Inside I tried to think. Tried to find a way out that didn't end with Amy getting hurt or me going to prison.

But every path I followed led to the same dead ends. If I told Amy about Snake's threats, she'd want to help. Would probably insist we go to the police or her parents or Mr. Donovan. And then what? Snake hadn't actually done anything yet. No proof, no evidence, just his word against mine. And in Riverside, a Morrison's word carried more weight than a Webb's.

Even if someone believed me, it would put Amy in danger. Snake would know I'd talked, would retaliate. He'd destroy her reputation just to prove a point, just to show the crew you didn't cross them without consequences.

If I went to Officer Garrett it would be even worse. Garrett already thought I was one mistake away from prison. Would probably assume I was making excuses, trying to get ahead of something. And he couldn't do anything about threats anyway—not until Snake actually committed a crime.

By then it would be too late.

The other option—doing the job—wasn't really an option at all. One criminal act and I violated probation. Adult prison, just like Danny. Everything I'd built these past months gone in one night.

But if I didn't do it, Snake would make good on his threats. Would tell everyone Amy Parker was keeping company with a criminal, would send photos to her college, would destroy the future she'd worked so hard for.

I couldn't let that happen.

I lay awake all night on Thursday, ceiling fan turning slow circles overhead, trying to think of a third choice that didn't exist.

Friday morning I showed up for my library shift because missing would violate probation. Mr. Donovan nodded his usual greeting and handed me the cart of books to shelve.

I kept my head down and got to work.

Amy wasn't scheduled to volunteer until afternoon, which gave me a few hours to figure out how to avoid her. Because I couldn't face her right now. Couldn't look her in the eye knowing I was lying, knowing I was trapped, knowing that just being near me put her at risk.

At one o'clock she walked through the front doors.

I was in the history section, back to the main floor, but I felt the moment she arrived. Felt her looking for me.

I grabbed the empty cart and headed for the storage room in back.

"Marcus?"

Her voice stopped me halfway across the floor. I didn't turn around.

"Hey, I gotta get these books from storage," I said, not looking back. "Mr. Donovan needs them for the display."

"Can we talk for a minute?"

"Kind of busy right now."

I kept walking. Made it to the storage room and closed the door behind me, heart pounding. Stood there in the dark among the old books and broken furniture, hating myself.

She didn't follow.

The rest of the afternoon I found excuses to stay away from the main floor. Organized the storage room. Fixed a wobbly table in the basement. Took an extra-long lunch break sitting in my truck, not eating the sandwich I'd brought.

When I came back inside Amy was at the children's reading corner helping a mother and her two kids pick out books. She looked up when I walked past. I looked away, pretended I hadn't seen her.

I saw her face fall before I turned away. Saw the hurt and confusion.

It felt like something breaking in my chest, but I kept walking.

At four o'clock I finished my shift and headed for the exit. Amy was at the front desk helping Mr. Donovan process returns. I tried to slip past but she called out.

"Marcus, wait."

I stopped, hand on the door. "Yeah?"

"Are you mad at me?" Her voice was quiet, careful. "Did I do something wrong?"

"No." The word came out too hard. "I'm just busy. Got a lot going on."

"You missed our session yesterday."

"I told you. Had to help my mom."

"And today you've been avoiding me all afternoon."

I finally looked at her. Mistake. Her brown eyes were hurt and searching and I wanted to tell her everything—about Snake, about the threats, about how I was trying to protect her even though it was killing me.

Instead I said, "I'm not avoiding you. I'm working. That's what I'm here for, remember? Community service."

She flinched like I'd slapped her.

Mr. Donovan looked up from his desk, frowning.

"I have to go," I said, and pushed through the door before either of them could stop me.

In my truck I sat with my forehead against the steering wheel, breathing hard.

Tonight was the deadline. Text Snake by tonight or he'd assume I wasn't coming.

I pulled out my phone and stared at it.

Saturday stretched out long and empty. Mom worked days so I had the house to myself. I tried to sleep but couldn't. Tried to eat but my stomach was twisted in knots. Ended up sitting on the front porch watching the neighborhood—kids playing in the street, Mrs. Chen watering her brown lawn, trucks rumbling past toward the rail yard.

Normal life happening all around me while I fell apart.

My phone rang at eight p.m. Unknown number.

I knew who it was before I answered.

"Marcus." Snake's voice was cheerful. "Haven't heard from you, brother. Starting to think you forgot about our conversation."

"I didn't forget."

"Good. So you're in?"

The words stuck in my throat. Yes meant prison. No meant destroying Amy.

"I need more time."

Silence on the other end. Then Snake laughed, sharp and humorless. "More time? For what? This isn't complicated, Marcus. You show up or you don't."

"Just a few more days. I need to figure things out."

"Figure what out? How to screw over your brothers? How to choose some girl over family?"

"She's not part of this."

"She is if you make her part of it." His voice went cold. "I gave you until tonight, Marcus. That was generous. Real generous considering you turned your back on us."

"Snake—"

"Tell you what. Because we go way back, because Danny's my boy, I'll give you until Tuesday. But that's it. Tuesday night, eleven p.m., depot. You're either there or I make some phone calls Wednesday morning. Your choice."

The line went dead.

I sat there on the porch steps, phone in my hand, as the last light faded from the sky.

Tuesday. Three more days.

Three more days to find a way out or accept there wasn't one.

---

Saturday night I didn't sleep. Sunday I went through the motions—made breakfast I didn't eat, pretended to watch TV, avoided my mother's concerned looks when she got home from her shift.

"You feeling okay?" she asked Sunday evening. "You look tired."

"Didn't sleep well."

"Something on your mind?"

Everything. Snake's threats. Amy's hurt face. The choice that wasn't a choice. Prison or destroying the girl I loved.

"Just work stuff," I said.

She studied me like she knew I was lying but didn't push. Just touched my shoulder as she passed toward her bedroom. "Get some rest, baby. Things look better in the morning."

But Monday morning came and nothing looked better.

I dragged myself to the library, exhausted and wired at the same time. Mr. Donovan took one look at me and asked if I was sick.

"Just tired," I said.

"Maybe take it easy today. Work at your own pace."

I nodded and got the book cart. Kept my head down. Stayed away from the front desk and the reading room and anywhere Amy might be.

She wasn't there anyway. Monday wasn't one of her volunteer days.

Which was a relief and also made everything worse, because not seeing her felt like losing something I'd never really had in the first place.

Monday night I lay awake again, staring at the ceiling, counting down hours.

Twenty-four hours until I had to be at the depot.

Twenty-four hours to find an answer.

But every time I circled back to the same truth: There was no good answer. No way to protect Amy without sacrificing myself. No way to save my future without putting her at risk.

I'd spent my whole life believing I was worthless, that guys like me didn't get good things. And now here was proof. Everything I touched turned to poison. Amy had been patient and kind and seen something worth saving in me.

And I was going to destroy her anyway.

Because that's what Webbs did. We destroyed things.

I rolled over and looked at Danny's empty room across the hall. My brother had made his choices and ended up in a cell. Now I was following the same path, pulled by the same gravity that dragged down everyone from south of the tracks.

Maybe Snake was right. Maybe you didn't get to walk away from the crew, didn't get to build a new life, didn't get the girl.

Maybe I'd been stupid to think I could be anything different.

Tuesday morning came and I still didn't have an answer.

But I had twelve hours until the deadline.

Twelve hours to decide who I was going to be.

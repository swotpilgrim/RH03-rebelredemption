# Chapter 13: Lines Crossed

Tuesday afternoon I was shelving in the back aisle between Literature and Philosophy. Narrow, barely fit the book cart.

The library was quiet—afternoon lull, most people at work or home. Just the whisper of air conditioning and Mrs. Chen at the circulation desk.

I heard footsteps.

"Marcus?"

Amy's voice made me turn.

She stood at the end of the aisle holding a slip of paper, pale green cardigan, hair pulled back.

"Hey," I said. "What's up?"

"I'm helping Mrs. Patterson find a book. It should be here." She checked her paper. "American poetry collection?"

"Up there." I pointed at the shelf above my head. "Which one?"

"Contemporary American Poetry, 1950 edition?"

The aisle was narrow. With my cart taking up most of the space and Amy standing in front of me, there was maybe two feet between us.

I could smell her perfume—something floral and light that I'd come to associate completely with her.

"Let me check." I reached for the shelf above my head, scanning spines for the right title.

Amy moved closer, trying to see the shelf herself. Our shoulders almost brushed.

"There," she said, pointing. "The blue one."

I reached for it at the same moment she did.

Our hands met on the spine of the book.

Both of us froze.

Amy's fingers were warm against mine, her hand smaller and softer than I'd imagined. We stood like that for a heartbeat too long—two people reaching for the same book, hands touching, neither of us pulling away.

Then I wrapped my fingers around the spine and pulled the volume free.

But I didn't step back.

Didn't create the distance that library protocol and common sense demanded.

Instead I turned, still holding the book, and found Amy right there.

Inches away.

Close enough to see the gold flecks in her hazel eyes. Close enough to count the faint freckles across her nose. Close enough that if I leaned forward even slightly our faces would touch.

The air between us felt electric. Charged with every unspoken word, every careful touch, every moment we'd been pretending this was just tutoring.

Amy's lips parted slightly. Her eyes dropped to my mouth for half a second before returning to meet mine.

I wanted to kiss her.

Wanted it so badly my hands shook with the effort of staying still. Wanted to close those final inches, to find out if her lips were as soft as they looked, to stop pretending I wasn't completely in love with her.

But this was the library.

The place I was supposed to be serving my sentence, proving I could be better, staying out of trouble. Amy was the respectable Parker girl who'd spent her summer teaching me, who'd believed in me when no one else did. I was the Webb kid with a record and a crew tattoo and absolutely no right to be thinking about kissing her in the back aisle while Mrs. Chen worked the circulation desk thirty feet away.

This would ruin her.

Being seen with me like this—standing too close, looking at each other like the world had narrowed to just this moment—would destroy her reputation, give her mother ammunition, make everything infinitely worse.

I stepped back.

The movement felt like tearing something vital.

"Here." My voice came out rough, raw. I held out the book.

Amy took it slowly. Her fingers brushed mine again—deliberate this time, not accidental—and lingered for a heartbeat before pulling away.

"Thank you," she said softly.

"Yeah."

She didn't leave immediately. Just stood there looking at me with an expression I couldn't quite read. Something between want and regret and a question she wasn't asking out loud.

Then she turned and walked away, taking the book and the charged air and my ability to breathe normally with her.

I leaned against the shelf, heart pounding like I'd run a mile.

That had been...

I didn't have words for what that had been.

A moment. A line crossed. The acknowledgment of something we'd both been trying to ignore.

Amy had wanted me to kiss her.

I was almost certain. The way she'd looked at me, stood so close, her eyes dropping to my mouth—those weren't the actions of someone who just wanted a book from the top shelf.

And I'd stepped back like a coward.

No—not a coward. Like someone trying to protect her from the consequences of being with me.

But the distinction felt meaningless now, standing in the empty aisle with my hands still shaking.

Our session that afternoon was charged with something new.

We sat side by side at table three like always, working through science review questions. But every accidental touch felt significant. Every time our eyes met and held for a second too long, I remembered the aisle. The gold flecks. The almost-kiss that wasn't.

Amy seemed distracted too. She kept losing her place in the textbook, having to reread passages, explain concepts twice.

"Sorry," she said after the third time. "I'm not focused today."

"It's okay. I'm not either."

Our eyes met. Held.

Neither of us said what we were both thinking: that the back aisle had changed something, shifted the careful balance we'd been maintaining, made it impossible to pretend this was still just tutoring.

At three-thirty Amy started packing up her materials. But she was moving slowly, like she didn't really want to leave.

"Marcus?"

I looked up.

"About earlier. In the stacks." She kept her eyes on the textbook she was closing. "I'm not sorry."

The words hung in the air between us.

"Me neither," I said quietly.

She smiled—small but real—and left.

---

That night I replayed the moment endlessly.

The narrow aisle. Her hand on mine. The way she'd looked at me like I was worth wanting.

The almost-kiss.

I'd done the right thing. Protected her reputation, her future.

But I couldn't stop wondering what would have happened if I'd been selfish.

If I'd kissed her.

Would she have pulled away? Or kissed me back?

The question tormented me.

---

Wednesday I showed up still thinking about it.

Donovan had me reorganizing the local history section—hours in the back stacks. Quiet work that gave me too much time to think.

I was deep in the stacks when I heard voices. I stayed quiet.

"—just don't understand why you're being so stubborn."

Mrs. Parker. Clipped, disapproving.

"I'm not being stubborn. I'm doing my job." Amy's voice, quieter but firm.

"Your job is volunteering, not spending every minute with that boy."

That boy. My jaw clenched.

"His name is Marcus. I'm tutoring him for his GED."

"I've seen how you look at him. This isn't just tutoring."

Silence.

Then Amy: "What if it's not?"

My heart stopped.

"What?" Mrs. Parker's voice went sharp. "That boy is from south of the tracks. He has a record. He ran with a gang—"

"He's smart and he's trying. He works harder than half my students. He reads books I recommend and writes essays I didn't assign because he cares. He's—"

"He's not appropriate for you. I won't have you throwing away your future on some summer infatuation."

"He's not a project."

"Then what is he?"

Silence.

I held my breath, hidden in the stacks, knowing I shouldn't be hearing this but unable to move.

"I don't know," Amy said finally. "But he's important to me. And I'm not stopping our sessions just because you disapprove."

"Amy—"

"No, Mom. You don't get to decide who I spend my time with. I'm seventeen, not seven. And Marcus has been nothing but respectful. He works hard, he shows up on time, he treats the library and the books with care. Mr. Donovan has said so multiple times. Your problem isn't with him. It's with where he's from."

"His background matters, Amy. Where we come from, who our families are—these things matter in Riverside. You know that."

"Then maybe Riverside has it wrong."

The words echoed in the quiet stacks.

Then footsteps—Mrs. Parker walking away, her heels sharp on the library floor.

Amy didn't follow immediately. I heard her sigh, heard fabric rustle like she was leaning against a bookshelf.

I should have stayed hidden. Should have let her have this moment to herself.

Instead I stepped around the corner of the aisle.

Amy looked up, startled. Her eyes widened when she saw me.

"How much did you hear?" she asked quietly.

"Enough."

She closed her eyes. "Marcus—"

"You defended me," I said. "To your mother. You told her I mattered to you."

"I did."

"Why?"

Amy opened her eyes and looked at me directly. "Because it's true. You do matter. More than..."

She trailed off, but I heard what she didn't say.

More than you should. More than is safe. More than makes sense.

I took a step closer. We were in the open stacks now, not the narrow aisle, with clear sightlines to anyone who might walk past. But I didn't care.

"You matter to me too," I said. "More than I know what to do with."

Amy's breath caught. "Marcus—"

"I know this is complicated. I know your mother's right that I'm all wrong for you. Wrong background, wrong family, wrong everything. But I can't stop—"

"Don't." Her voice was almost a whisper. "Don't say you'll stay away. Don't say we should stop the sessions. Don't do the noble thing and walk away for my own good."

"Then what do you want me to do?"

"I want you to keep showing up. Keep trying. Keep being..." She gestured helplessly. "Keep being you. That's all."

We stood there in the stacks, two people who shouldn't want each other finding every reason to anyway.

"Same time Thursday?" I asked.

"Same time Thursday," she confirmed.

---

Thursday came.

I showed up at 1:55. Amy was already there.

We worked through our session like always. But everything was different now. The almost-kiss in the aisle. The overheard conversation with her mother. The admission that we mattered to each other.

All of it hung in the air between us, impossible to ignore.

When the session ended and I walked to my truck, I saw Mrs. Parker's Buick parked across the street.

She was watching. Keeping tabs.

Making sure Amy knew the cost of choosing me.

But as I drove home, I thought about Amy's words: "Keep showing up."

So that's what I'd do.

Show up. Keep trying. Keep fighting for every moment we could steal.

Even if the whole world—and Mrs. Parker in particular—thought I wasn't good enough.

Amy thought I was worth it.

And that was enough to keep me going.

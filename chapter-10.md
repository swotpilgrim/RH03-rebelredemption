# Chapter 10: Falling Despite Himself

I didn't sleep Sunday or Monday night.

Every time I closed my eyes I saw Snake's smile, heard his voice talking about Mom walking alone through dark parking lots.

Monday I called in sick—first time I'd missed a day in six weeks. I couldn't face Amy. Couldn't pretend everything was fine when my world was collapsing.

I spent the day watching the house, waiting for Snake's guys to show up. Trying to figure out how to protect Mom without becoming the person I was trying to stop being.

No answers came.

Tuesday morning I dragged myself to the library, exhausted and strung tight. My hands shook as I shelved books.

Two o'clock came too fast.

---

Amy was already at table three, materials set out, that calm smile in place. But it faltered when she saw me.

"Are you okay? You look—"

"I'm fine." The words came out harder than I meant them. "Let's just get started."

She studied me for a second, concern clear on her face, but she didn't push. Just slid a worksheet across the table.

"We're working on quadratic equations today. Remember the formula we went over last week?"

I stared at the page. Numbers and variables swam together, meaningless. I couldn't focus, couldn't think about anything except Snake's threat and the impossible choice it represented.

"Marcus?"

"What?" I looked up.

"The formula. Do you remember it?"

Did I remember it? I could barely remember my own name right now.

"No," I admitted.

Amy's expression softened. "Okay. That's fine. Let me review—"

"I said I don't remember, okay? Can you just—" I shoved the worksheet away, immediately regretting the motion. "Sorry. I just... I don't know."

Silence settled over our table. Around us the library hummed with its usual quiet activity, but at table three everything had gone still.

"What's wrong?" Amy's voice was gentle, patient. Too patient for someone dealing with my attitude.

"Nothing's wrong."

"Marcus—"

"I said nothing." The snap in my voice surprised both of us.

Amy set down her pencil carefully. For a second I thought she'd pack up her things and leave, tell Mr. Donovan she was done wasting her time on someone who couldn't even show up to a tutoring session in the right headspace.

Instead she just looked at me with those clear eyes that saw too much.

"You don't have to tell me what's going on," she said quietly. "But you should know I'm not going anywhere just because you're having a bad day."

The words hit like a sucker punch.

"Why?" The question came out raw. "Why are you even here, Amy? You could be doing anything else with your summer. You don't owe me anything. I'm just some project to you—"

"You're not a project."

"Then what am I?" I met her eyes, all my frustration and fear spilling over. "Some charity case? The bad boy you're fixing to make yourself feel good? What?"

Amy's jaw tightened. "Is that really what you think?"

I didn't know what I thought anymore. Didn't know anything except that I was falling apart and dragging her down with me.

"I think you should go," I said. "Tell your mother she was right. Tell everyone they were right—the Webb kid isn't worth the trouble."

For a long moment Amy just sat there. Then she stood.

My stomach dropped. This was it. She was leaving, and I'd pushed her away, and—

She walked around the table and sat in the chair next to mine instead of across from me.

"Listen to me," she said, her voice quiet but firm. "I don't know what's happening in your life right now. I don't know what has you so scared and angry. But I need you to understand something."

I waited.

"I make my own choices about who I spend time with," Amy continued. "My mother doesn't make those choices. The town doesn't make them. I do. And I choose to be here. With you. Not because you're a project or a charity case, but because I care about you. As a person. As someone who's working really hard to build a better life. As... as someone who matters to me."

The last words came out softer, almost uncertain.

Something in my chest cracked wide open.

"You shouldn't care about me," I said, my voice rough. "I'm just going to mess everything up. That's what I do. Ruin things."

"You're not ruining anything."

"You don't know that. You don't know what's—" I stopped, the words catching in my throat.

"What's what?" Amy asked gently.

I couldn't tell her about Snake. Couldn't drag her into that mess, make her aware of the threats, put her at risk. But the weight of keeping it inside was crushing me.

"My old life keeps trying to pull me back," I admitted. "People from before. They don't want to let me go. And I'm scared that..." I trailed off.

"Scared of what?"

"That I'm dragging you down into my mess. That being associated with me is going to ruin your reputation, screw up your college applications, make your life harder. That I'm poison and everything I touch turns bad."

There. The ugly truth I'd been carrying around, laid out between us.

Amy was quiet for a long moment. When she spoke, her voice was steady.

"You're not poison, Marcus. And you don't get to decide what's good for me. That's my choice."

"But—"

"My choice," she repeated firmly. "I see you. All of you—the parts that are struggling and the parts that are brave enough to try anyway. And I choose this. I choose being here. Do you understand?"

I stared at her. At the determination in her eyes, the stubborn set of her jaw. She meant it. Every word.

And something fundamental shifted.

All this time I'd been trying to keep distance. Trying to protect her from me, protect myself from the inevitable moment when she realized I wasn't worth the effort. Building walls and keeping her at arm's length despite knowing I was already falling.

But she was choosing to be here anyway.

Choosing me.

The realization hit with the force of a freight train: I was in love with her.

Not the crush I'd been pretending this was. Not simple attraction or gratitude for her help with the GED. Real, terrifying, all-consuming love for Amy Parker who saw past every wall I'd built, who called me on my bullshit, who defended me to strangers and showed up twice a week with patience and textbooks and the quiet belief that I could be someone better.

And I was so completely, utterly screwed.

"Marcus?" Amy's voice pulled me back. "Are you okay?"

"No," I said honestly. "But I will be."

She smiled slightly. "Do you want to talk about what's going on?"

I wanted to tell her everything. But dragging her into Snake's threats felt like the exact kind of poison I'd just claimed not to be.

"Not yet," I said. "But... thank you. For not leaving."

"I told you. I'm not going anywhere."

The words settled over me, warm and dangerous and absolutely terrifying.

---

We spent the rest of the session working through equations, and I actually managed to focus. Amy's presence next to me instead of across felt different—closer, more intimate in a way that made my heart race.

When the hour ended, Amy packed up her materials but didn't immediately leave.

"Whatever's happening," she said quietly, "you don't have to handle it alone. Okay?"

"Okay."

She hesitated, then touched my hand briefly. The contact lasted maybe two seconds but I felt it for the rest of the day.

Then she left, and I sat alone at table three trying to process what had just happened.

---

That night I lay in bed with the window open and finally admitted the truth.

I was in love with Amy Parker.

Completely. Hopelessly. Terrified because I had no idea what to do with feelings this big.

She was everything I wasn't—good, patient, from a family that mattered. She had plans and a future that probably didn't include a guy with a record and an unfinished GED.

But she'd chosen to be here. Had sat next to me instead of walking away. Had said I mattered to her.

And that changed everything.

I thought about Snake's threats. The impossible choice between protecting Mom and protecting the life I was building. How falling for Amy made everything more complicated.

But I couldn't stop. Couldn't put this feeling back in the box.

I was in too deep.

Had been for weeks. Didn't matter when it started. What mattered was I was here now, drowning in feelings I didn't know how to handle, for a girl I had no right to want.

And she cared back.

Across the hall, Danny's empty room sat dark. A reminder of bad choices.

But Amy wasn't pulling me under. She was the only thing keeping me above water.

Protecting the people I loved—Mom, Amy, the life I was building—meant conflicting things now.

Do the job Snake wanted, keep Mom safe but destroy everything I'd worked for? Or refuse and risk Mom's safety while trying to protect a future that might not exist?

No good answer.

But lying there thinking about Amy's hand on mine and the way she'd said I mattered, I knew one thing:

I was going to fight for this.

For her. For the person she made me want to be. For the impossible future where a guy like me could deserve a girl like her.

Even if that fight destroyed me.

Even if I was scared out of my mind.

Because being with Amy—even just sitting across from her twice a week working through textbooks—was worth any price.

And I was done pretending otherwise.

---

Thursday I showed up at table three at two o'clock sharp.

Amy was already there, setting up materials. She looked up when I sat down and gave me that small smile.

"How are you doing?"

"Better," I said. And meant it.

Whatever was coming with Snake, whatever impossible choices I'd have to make, at least I knew this much: Amy mattered. What we had—tutoring sessions that had become something more—mattered.

And I was going to protect it.

No matter what it cost.

"Good," Amy said. "Ready to tackle those quadratic equations for real this time?"

"Yeah," I said, meeting her eyes. "Let's do it."

And for ninety minutes I sat next to Amy Parker and worked through math problems and tried not to think about how completely in love with her I was.

Tried and failed.

But for once, the failure felt like the best thing that had ever happened to me.

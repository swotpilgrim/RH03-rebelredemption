# Chapter 15: Midpoint—Admission

Late August.

The heat had reached that point where it stopped feeling oppressive and just became permanent. The library was nearly empty—most people stayed home, waiting for evening relief that never came.

Mrs. Parker wasn't at the circulation desk today. Church meeting, Amy had mentioned. First time in two weeks she hadn't been hovering.

The absence felt significant.

---

Our session started like normal—algebra problems Amy had marked for review, equations I'd struggled with in my practice tests. But neither of us could focus.

The quiet library, the empty tables around us, the rare moment of being unwatched—it all felt charged with possibility.

"You're distracted," Amy said after I worked the same problem wrong twice.

"So are you." I gestured at her textbook. "You've been on the same page for ten minutes."

She smiled. "Fair point."

We sat there for a moment in companionable silence, the algebra forgotten.

"Can I ask you something?" Amy said finally.

"Yeah."

"What do you want? After the GED, I mean. After your community service is done and you've passed the test. What comes next?"

I'd been avoiding thinking about that. The future felt too uncertain, too dependent on variables I couldn't control.

"I don't know," I admitted. "Haven't really thought past getting through this summer."

"But if you could do anything. If money and reputation and Riverside's judgment weren't factors. What would you want?"

I considered the question seriously. "Maybe work at a garage. I'm good with cars, good with my hands. Or..." I trailed off.

"Or what?"

"Maybe community college. If I could afford it. Study something practical—automotive tech or maybe business management. Learn something that could actually lead somewhere."

"That's a great plan."

"It's a fantasy," I said. "Community college costs money I don't have. And even if I could scrape it together, who's going to hire a Webb with a record for anything beyond grunt work?"

"You don't know that."

"Yes, I do. I've lived here my whole life. I know exactly how Riverside works."

Amy was quiet for a moment. "What about leaving?"

The question surprised me. "Leaving?"

"Riverside. California, even. There are places where nobody knows your name or your history. Where you could start over completely fresh."

I thought about it. The idea had appeal—walking away from the railroad tracks and the judgment and the weight of being a Webb in a town that had already decided what that meant.

"Maybe," I said slowly. "Year ago I would've said definitely. Would've left the second I could and never looked back."

"And now?"

Now everything was different. Now leaving meant leaving Amy, and that felt impossible.

"Now I'm not sure," I said carefully.

Amy studied me. "What changed?"

You. Everything about you.

But I couldn't say that. Couldn't lay my heart out that bare when I had no idea if she felt even a fraction of what I was feeling.

"Found reasons to stay," I said instead. "Things worth fighting for here."

Amy's breath caught slightly. "Like what?"

"Like proving everyone wrong about me. Like showing Riverside that Webbs can be more than our worst choices. Like..." I met her eyes. "Like not running away from things that matter just because they're hard."

The air between us felt electric.

"What about you?" I asked, shifting the focus before I said something I couldn't take back. "What do you want after graduation?"

Amy looked down at her textbook. "Everyone expects me to go to college. My parents have been saving since I was born. I'm supposed to apply to schools, get accepted, move away and study something respectable."

"But?"

"But I'm terrified." The admission came out quiet. "Everyone talks about college like it's this amazing adventure, this great next step. But the idea of leaving everything I know, going somewhere completely new where I don't know anyone..." She trailed off.

"You're one of the smartest people I know. You'd handle it fine."

"Would I?" Amy looked up. "I've lived in Riverside my whole life. Same house, same school, same church, same everything. What if I'm not brave enough to start over somewhere new?"

"You're brave enough for anything."

"How do you know?"

"Because you sat across from me and decided to teach algebra. Because you stood up to your mother when she wanted you to stop. Because you defended me to people talking trash." I leaned forward. "Brave isn't not being scared. It's being scared and doing it anyway."

Amy smiled slightly. "Is that from a book I recommended?"

"No. That's from watching you."

She blushed and looked away.

"I don't feel brave," she said quietly. "Most of the time I feel like I'm faking it. Like everyone thinks I have my life together but really I'm just going through motions, doing what's expected."

"I know the feeling."

"Do you?" Amy met my eyes. "You're the one actually changing. Actually fighting to be different. I'm just existing. Meeting expectations."

"You're more than that."

"Am I? The only real choice I've made all summer is choosing to keep tutoring you." She paused. "And that's the only thing that feels genuinely mine. Not my parents' plan or the town's expectations. Just mine."

The words hung between us, heavy with implication.

"I don't want to leave for college," Amy said suddenly. "I mean, I know I should. I know it's the smart thing, the right thing. But the idea of going somewhere I don't know anyone, where I have to start completely over..." She shook her head. "It terrifies me."

"What would you do instead? If college wasn't the expectation?"

"I don't know. Maybe stay local. Go to community college. Study education, become a teacher. Work with kids who need help, like..." She gestured at the space between us. "Like this. Real tutoring, real teaching. Not just checking boxes on college applications."

"That's a good plan."

"My mother would kill me."

"It's your life."

"Is it?" Amy's voice held frustration I'd never heard. "Sometimes it feels like everyone else has more say in my life than I do. My mother dictating who I can spend time with. The town judging every choice. Even college—I never actually decided I wanted to go. Everyone just assumed I would."

I understood that feeling. The weight of other people's expectations, the way they narrowed your options until you couldn't see any path but the one laid out for you.

"Then make your own choice," I said. "Not what your mother wants or what the town expects. What you want."

"What if I don't know what I want?"

"Then figure it out. You've got time."

Amy laughed quietly. "Says the guy who just admitted he has no idea what comes after this summer."

"Exactly. We're equally lost."

"Maybe." She smiled. "But at least we're lost together."

The words settled over us like a benediction.

Together.

Like whatever came next, we'd face it side by side instead of alone.

Like this thing between us—unnamed, undefined, but undeniably real—would continue beyond tutoring sessions and community service.

"Marcus?"

I looked up.

"If you did leave Riverside. Started over somewhere new. Would you..." She trailed off.

"Would I what?"

"Would you want someone to come with you?"

My heart stopped.

Was she asking what I thought she was asking?

"Depends who was offering," I said carefully.

Amy met my eyes. "What if it was me?"

The world condensed to that moment. To Amy looking at me with vulnerable honesty, asking if I'd want her in my hypothetical future.

"Then yeah," I said, voice rough. "I'd want that. I'd want you there."

"Even though I'm terrified of leaving?"

"Even though. We could be terrified together."

She smiled—that real, unguarded smile that transformed her whole face. "I like that. Being terrified together sounds better than being scared alone."

"We're both braver than we think," I said, echoing our earlier conversation.

"Maybe. Or maybe we just make each other brave."

Yeah, I thought. That's exactly it.

Amy made me brave enough to try for a GED, to stand up to Snake, to believe I could be more than my mistakes.

And maybe—impossibly—I made her brave enough to question expectations, to make her own choices, to imagine a future different from the one everyone assumed she'd have.

---

The session ended at four but neither of us moved to leave.

We sat there at table three, textbooks forgotten, talking about futures we weren't sure we'd have. About dreams that felt impossible. About the terrifying possibility that maybe—just maybe—we could have something real.

"I should go," Amy said finally. "My mom will be done with her meeting soon."

"Yeah."

But she didn't stand up immediately.

"Marcus? Earlier you said you found reasons to stay in Riverside. Things worth fighting for."

"Yeah."

"Was I..." She hesitated. "Was I one of those reasons?"

I could lie. Could deflect. Could protect myself from the vulnerability of admitting how completely she'd become the center of my world.

Instead I told the truth.

"You're the reason," I said. "Not one of them. The only one that actually matters."

Amy's eyes went bright. "Oh."

"Is that okay?"

"Yeah." Her voice was barely a whisper. "That's okay."

We looked at each other across the small distance between us, and something shifted. Some invisible line crossed. The acknowledgment that this wasn't just tutoring, wasn't just friendship, wasn't just a summer thing that would fade when fall came.

This was real. This mattered. This was worth fighting for.

Amy stood slowly. "Same time Thursday?"

"Same time Thursday."

She gathered her materials but paused before leaving. "For what it's worth? You're my reason too."

Then she was gone, leaving me alone at table three with a heart too full and hands that shook slightly as I packed up my notebook.

---

I drove home in a daze.

Amy had admitted I was her reason. Had implied she'd leave Riverside with me. Had looked at me like I was someone worth choosing.

The weight of that terrified me.

Because now I had something to lose. Someone who mattered more than anything before.

And every threat from Snake, every disapproving look from Mrs. Parker, every whisper became more dangerous. They weren't just threats to me.

They were threats to us.

To whatever this fragile thing between us was becoming.

That night I couldn't sleep.

I lay thinking about Amy's question and my answer.

The truth was bigger than leaving or staying, than Riverside or somewhere new.

Wherever I ended up, whatever future I built—I wanted Amy in it.

Not as my tutor. Not as the good girl who'd believed in me one summer.

As mine.

The most terrifying, wonderful thing I'd ever let myself want.

For the first time in my life, I had something worth losing.

And I'd fight like hell to keep it.

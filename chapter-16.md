# Chapter 16: Crew Problems

The trash bag was heavy, cutting into my palm as I pushed through the library's back door into the alley. Thursday afternoon heat hit me like a wall—still over ninety degrees even though it was almost five o'clock. The dumpster sat at the far end of the narrow alley, surrounded by the smell of rotting fruit from the grocer next door and old paper from the library's discarded books.

I was halfway to the dumpster when I realized I wasn't alone.

Snake stepped out from behind the dumpster, blocking the alley exit. No warning, no sound—just suddenly there, arms crossed over his chest, that cold smile on his face I remembered too well from my crew days.

My stomach dropped.

"Marcus." His voice was casual, friendly even, but I heard the steel underneath. "Been a while."

I stopped walking. The trash bag suddenly felt like it weighed a hundred pounds. "Snake."

"Didn't think you'd remember me," he said, pushing off from the dumpster and walking toward me slow and deliberate. "Seeing as you've been too busy for your brothers lately."

"I've been working." I kept my voice flat, neutral. Every instinct screamed at me to run, but I couldn't show fear. Not to Snake. "Community service. You know that."

"Oh, I know." He was close now, close enough I could see the scar above his left eyebrow from the fight that put his older brother away. Close enough to smell cigarettes and engine grease. "Been watching you, Marcus. Seen you real busy shelving books, playing student with that pretty tutor of yours."

The way he said "pretty tutor" made my hands curl into fists. I forced them to relax. "What do you want?"

Snake's smile disappeared. "Crew needs you this weekend. Saturday night. Simple job, in and out."

"I'm out, Snake. You know that." My voice came out steadier than I felt. "I'm done with that life."

"Done?" He laughed, sharp and humorless. "Nobody's done with the crew, Marcus. We took care of you when your old man split. We gave you family when you didn't have shit. Danny and me, we brought you in, made you somebody."

"Danny's in county." The words tasted bitter. "Where I'm headed if I screw up my probation."

"Danny made mistakes." Snake stepped closer, invading my space, forcing me to either back up or stand my ground. I stood my ground. "You're smarter than that. This job is clean, easy money. We need a fourth guy. You owe us."

"I don't owe you anything."

His expression changed, all the false friendliness dropping away to show the danger underneath. "That's where you're wrong, Webb. You owe us everything. Two years we had your back. Two years of brotherhood. You don't just walk away from that because some judge scared you straight."

"I'm not doing it." My heart hammered against my ribs but I kept my voice firm. "Find someone else."

Snake was silent for a long moment, studying me. Then his eyes flicked past me toward the library's back door and that cold smile returned. "That tutor of yours. Amy Parker, right? Hardware store family. Real nice girl. Real respectable."

Everything in me went cold and sharp. "Don't."

"Don't what?" His voice was innocent but his eyes were predator-calculating. "I'm just making conversation, Marcus. Noticing how much time you spend with the Parker girl. Twice a week, right? Tuesdays and Thursdays. Cozy study sessions in the back of the library."

I realized my mistake too late—I'd glanced back toward the library door, just for a second, and Snake had seen it. Had seen exactly what mattered to me.

"Leave her out of this," I said, voice low and dangerous.

"Out of what?" Snake spread his hands, all false innocence. "I'm not doing anything. Yet. But you know how small towns are, Marcus. People talk. Bet the Parker family wouldn't like people talking about their college-bound daughter spending all that time with a Webb. With a criminal. With a guy still wearing his crew ink."

The threat was clear as daylight. My breath came faster, anger mixing with fear in my chest. "If you touch her—if you even look at her wrong—I'll kill you, Snake. I swear to God."

He laughed, genuine amusement this time. "There he is. There's the Marcus I know. Still got some fight in you after all. That's good. Real good. You're gonna need that fight Saturday night."

"I'm not doing your job."

"Yeah, you are." Snake's voice went flat, final. "Because here's how this works. You show up Saturday night at the depot, eleven o'clock. You help with the job like a good brother. Or Sunday morning I start talking to people. Talking about how the Parker girl's been keeping company with a criminal. How she's been sneaking around with a guy who's violated probation. How maybe she's not as perfect as everyone thinks."

"I haven't violated probation."

"Yet." He smiled. "And nobody's gonna believe a Webb over what people see with their own eyes. I got friends who'd be happy to tell Mr. Parker all about the punk corrupting his daughter. Maybe send some anonymous tips to that college she's applying to. Stanford, right? Think they want a girl who associates with gang members?"

Rage flooded through me, hot and sharp, and I took a step forward before I could stop myself. Snake didn't back up—he wanted me to swing, wanted an excuse. I forced myself to stop, fists shaking at my sides.

"Smart boy," Snake said softly. "See, you do still know how to think. So here's what you're gonna do. Saturday night, eleven p.m., abandoned depot. Bring your truck. We'll be done by two a.m. and you can go back to playing good boy at your library."

"And if I don't?"

"Then I make one phone call to your probation officer about a Webb hanging around that nice Parker girl. Another call to her daddy. Maybe some photos of you at the depot get sent around—don't matter if you were there for a job or not, people will believe what they want to believe. Your new life falls apart either way. Difference is, if you help us Saturday, you get to keep pretending you're better than you are."

He was right and we both knew it. The system was designed against guys like me. One accusation, one rumor, one photo out of context and I'd lose everything—probation, the library, Amy. Even if I could prove I wasn't there, wasn't involved, the damage would be done. Amy's reputation would be destroyed just by association with me.

"Friday," Snake said, voice going friendly again like we'd just been having a casual conversation. "That's your deadline, Marcus. Text me by Friday night, let me know you're in. Or Sunday I start making calls. Your choice."

He walked past me toward the alley exit, close enough his shoulder almost brushed mine. I stood frozen, trash bag still in my hand, watching him go.

At the mouth of the alley he stopped and looked back. "Good seeing you, brother. Real good. See you Saturday."

Then he was gone, disappearing around the corner onto Main Street like he'd never been there at all.

I stood in the alley for a long time after, breathing hard. The trash bag fell from my numb fingers and hit the ground with a dull thud.

Snake had me trapped. Do the job and violate probation. Don't do it and he destroys Amy's reputation, her future. No good choice. No way out.

I thought about Amy inside the library, probably wondering where I'd gone. Her patient smile when I finally understood a problem. How she looked at me like I was worth something, like I could be better than my past.

If Snake spread rumors about us, it would destroy everything she'd worked for. College applications, reputation, her family's standing—all of it gone because of me.

I picked up the trash bag and threw it into the dumpster harder than necessary, the crash echoing off the alley walls.

My hands were shaking. From rage or fear, I couldn't tell anymore. Maybe both.

Inside the library Amy would be waiting for our next session, would smile when I came back in, would ask if everything was okay. And I'd have to lie to her. Had to keep her away from this, had to protect her from the poison of my past that kept trying to pull me under.

Two days until Friday. Two days to figure out how to save her without destroying myself.

I walked back toward the library door, legs feeling heavy as concrete. Through the small window I could see Amy at our usual table, books spread out, tucking that strand of hair behind her ear the way she always did when she was concentrating.

Snake's words echoed in my head: *Nobody's done with the crew.*

Maybe he was right. Maybe guys like me didn't get to walk away, didn't get to build new lives. Maybe I'd been stupid to think I could be anything other than what the town expected—a Webb from south of the tracks, destined for the same cell as my brother.

But looking at Amy through that window, I knew I'd do anything to keep her safe. Even if it meant going back. Even if it meant losing everything.

I pulled open the door and walked inside, the air conditioning hitting my sweat-soaked shirt and making me shiver. Amy looked up and smiled.

"There you are," she said. "Thought maybe you got lost."

"Just taking out trash," I managed, voice rough.

"You okay? You look pale."

"Fine. Just hot out there."

She studied me for a second too long, like she could see through the lie, but then nodded and gestured to the chair across from her. "Come on, we've got twenty minutes before I have to leave. Let's finish this chapter on American history."

I sat down, picked up my pencil, tried to focus on the words in front of me.

But all I could think about was Saturday night and the choice that wasn't really a choice at all.

Snake had won. He'd known exactly how to trap me—not with threats against me, but with threats against the one person who mattered more than my own freedom.

And the worst part was, Amy had no idea the danger she was in just by knowing me.

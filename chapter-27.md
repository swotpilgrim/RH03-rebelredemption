# Chapter 27: The Hearing

Tuesday morning I stood before Judge Harrison in the same courtroom where this had all started four months ago. Back then I'd been seventeen, a juvenile offender getting one last chance before adult consequences.

Now I was eighteen, in an orange jumpsuit, facing those adult consequences.

The courtroom looked exactly the same—dark wood paneling, California state flag, the judge's bench elevated above everyone else. But everything felt different. Heavier. Final.

Sarah Chen stood beside me in her black suit. Behind us in the gallery sat Mom, Mr. Donovan, and Amy. I could feel their presence without turning around.

Judge Harrison looked older than I remembered. More tired. He reviewed the file in front of him with the kind of expression that said he'd seen this story a hundred times before.

"Mr. Webb," he said finally. "We meet again."

"Yes, your Honor."

"Four months ago I gave you a chance. Community service instead of juvenile detention. The opportunity to prove you could change." He looked up. "How did that work out?"

The question was rhetorical but I answered anyway. "I messed up, your Honor. Made bad choices. But I'm here to take responsibility for them."

"So I see." He gestured to Sarah. "Counselor, you may present your client's case."

Sarah stepped forward. "Your Honor, my client is guilty of the charges brought against him. We're not contesting that. But there are significant mitigating circumstances the court should consider."

She laid out the case she'd built yesterday—Snake's threats, the coercion, my attempts to comply with probation until I was backed into an impossible corner. My cooperation with police, willingness to testify against the crew.

"Additionally," Sarah said, "we have three character witnesses who can speak to Marcus's genuine attempts at rehabilitation before this incident."

The judge nodded. "Call your first witness."

Mr. Donovan approached the stand, was sworn in. He looked calm and professional, every inch the ex-military librarian who'd seen it all.

"Mr. Donovan," Sarah began. "How do you know Marcus Webb?"

"He completed community service at Riverside Public Library under my supervision. Two hundred hours over four months."

"And during that time, how would you characterize his behavior?"

Donovan glanced at me, then back to Sarah. "Exemplary. Marcus showed up on time every day. Followed all rules and directives. Worked hard, took initiative, treated the library and patrons with respect." He paused. "More importantly, he was pursuing his GED. Studying during breaks, taking practice tests. He passed the examination three weeks ago."

I saw the judge's eyebrows rise slightly.

"In your professional opinion," Sarah asked, "was Marcus genuinely trying to change his life?"

"Absolutely," Donovan said without hesitation. "I've supervised dozens of community service workers over the years. Most do the minimum required and leave. Marcus was different. He actually cared about doing good work. About being better than his past."

"Thank you. No further questions."

The prosecutor—a middle-aged woman named Davis—stood for cross-examination.

"Mr. Donovan, isn't it true that despite this alleged rehabilitation, Mr. Webb still chose to participate in a criminal burglary?"

"Yes," Donovan admitted. "But—"

"No further questions."

She sat down. Donovan left the stand, frustration visible in the set of his shoulders.

"Call your next witness," the judge said.

Mom approached the stand. She looked small up there, worn down by double shifts and worry, but her voice was steady when she spoke.

Sarah asked her about my attempts to change after Danny went to prison. About the threats Snake had made to her safety. About finding me Sunday morning terrified but determined to face consequences.

"Mrs. Webb," Sarah said gently. "Do you believe your son was trying to protect you when he participated in this burglary?"

"Yes." Mom's voice was firm. "Marcus made a terrible choice. But he made it because he was scared for the people he loves. That doesn't excuse it, but it explains it."

Prosecutor Davis's cross was brief and brutal.

"Mrs. Webb, your older son is currently incarcerated for auto theft, is that correct?"

"Yes."

"And now your younger son faces prison time for burglary. Would you say criminal behavior runs in your family?"

Sarah objected. The judge sustained it. But the damage was done—the implication hanging in the air that guys like me were destined for this.

Mom stepped down, eyes wet.

"Final witness," the judge said.

Amy walked to the stand. She wore a simple blue dress, hair pulled back, looking every inch the college-bound good girl from the right side of town.

Our eyes met briefly before she was sworn in.

Sarah's questioning was careful. How did Amy know me? Through the tutoring program at the library. What was I like as a student? Dedicated, hardworking, genuinely wanting to learn. Did I tell her about Snake's threats? Yes. What did she think I was trying to do?

"He was trying to protect me," Amy said clearly. "Snake threatened to destroy my reputation and college applications. Marcus thought if he did this one job, Snake would leave me alone. He was wrong, and he made a terrible choice. But his intention was protecting someone he cared about."

"Miss Parker," Sarah said. "You're seventeen years old, college-bound, from a respected family in Riverside. Why are you here testifying for Marcus Webb?"

Amy looked right at me when she answered.

"Because I believe people are more than their worst mistakes. Because Marcus showed me for months that he was trying to be better—and he was succeeding until he was threatened. Because he deserves someone to stand up for him the way he tried to stand up for me, even if he did it wrong."

Her voice was steady, clear, full of a conviction that made my chest tight.

"Do you believe Marcus Webb can be rehabilitated?" Sarah asked.

"Yes," Amy said without hesitation. "If given the chance."

Prosecutor Davis stood for cross-examination.

"Miss Parker, isn't it true that your association with Mr. Webb has damaged your own reputation?"

"Probably." Amy lifted her chin. "I don't care."

"You don't care that people in this town talk about you dating a criminal?"

"We're not dating," Amy corrected. "We're friends. And no, I don't care what people say. I care about doing what's right."

"No further questions."

Amy stepped down. As she passed the defense table her eyes met mine again. I had to look away because the faith in her expression hurt too much—I didn't deserve it, didn't deserve her standing up there risking her reputation for me.

But she'd done it anyway.

"Counselor," the judge said to Prosecutor Davis. "Your closing statement."

Davis stood. "Your Honor, the defendant committed burglary while on probation. The circumstances—coercion or otherwise—don't change the facts. He broke into a building, participated in vandalism and theft, violated the trust this court placed in him. The charges are serious and warrant serious consequences. The state recommends two to three years in state prison plus extended probation."

Two to three years. My throat was tight.

Sarah stood for our closing.

"Your Honor, Marcus Webb is eighteen years old. He made terrible mistakes under extreme duress—threats to his mother's safety, threats to his friend's future. The moment he could, he turned himself in. Confessed completely. Agreed to testify against career criminals who exploited him. He passed his GED while awaiting this hearing, showing continued commitment to rehabilitation."

She paused, then continued.

"Marcus isn't asking for mercy he doesn't deserve. He's asking for the chance to prove the last four months of progress weren't a lie. That the young man Mr. Donovan and Miss Parker described is who he really is, not the scared kid who made one catastrophic mistake."

She looked at the judge directly.

"Six months county jail plus probation allows Marcus to serve time for his crime while maintaining the rehabilitation track he was on. Prison destroys that. Please give him the chance to prove he's worth saving."

She sat down.

The courtroom was silent.

Judge Harrison reviewed the file again, expression unreadable. Finally he looked up.

"Mr. Webb, stand."

I stood, legs unsteady.

"You received an extraordinary gift four months ago—a second chance when most young men in your position would have been detained. You were making progress. Real, documented progress. And then you threw it away."

I looked down, unable to meet his eyes.

"However," the judge continued, "having reviewed the testimony and evidence, I'm persuaded that your actions, while criminal and unacceptable, were not undertaken with malice or forethought. You were coerced by individuals who exploited your fear and loyalty. That doesn't excuse your choices, but it does provide context."

He paused, considering.

"I'm also persuaded by the testimony of people who know you well that you are genuinely attempting to change your life. That matters. Rehabilitation is possible, Mr. Webb, but only if you're given the opportunity to pursue it."

Hope flickered in my chest, fragile and terrifying.

"Therefore, I'm sentencing you as follows: Six months in Riverside County Jail with credit for time already served. Followed by two years supervised probation with strict conditions—weekly check-ins, maintained employment or education, random drug testing, no contact with known gang members. You will complete your GED requirements if you haven't already, and pursue either employment or post-secondary education upon release."

Six months. Not two years. Not three. Six months.

"This is your final chance, Mr. Webb," the judge said sternly. "If you violate probation again, if you make any similar choices, I will not hesitate to impose the maximum sentence. Do you understand?"

"Yes, your Honor." My voice was hoarse. "Thank you, your Honor."

"Don't thank me. Thank the people who stood up here and vouched for you. And prove them right." He banged his gavel. "Court is adjourned."

The bailiff approached to take me back to holding.

I turned to look at the gallery. Mom was crying quietly. Mr. Donovan nodded once, firm and approving.

Amy met my eyes across the courtroom.

She mouthed two words: *I'll wait.*

And I believed her.

Six months. I could do six months.

And when I got out, I'd prove every single person who'd stood up for me that their faith wasn't misplaced.

The bailiff led me away.

But for the first time since Saturday night, I wasn't drowning in despair.

I had a future. Limited, conditional, but real.

And someone waiting for me when I came home.

That was more than I deserved.

But I'd spend six months—and every day after—trying to earn it.

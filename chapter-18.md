# Chapter 18: Amy Pushes Back

Amy was waiting by the front doors when I pulled into the library parking lot Tuesday morning.

Not inside. Outside. Leaning against the brick wall with her arms crossed, watching for my truck.

My stomach dropped.

I thought about driving away. Thought about calling Mr. Donovan and saying I was sick. Thought about a hundred ways to avoid this conversation.

But I was out of time and out of options and she'd already seen me.

I parked and got out. The morning was already hot, promising another scorcher. Amy pushed off from the wall and walked toward me.

"We need to talk," she said. Not angry, just firm. Final.

"I have to start my shift—"

"Library doesn't open for another twenty minutes." She gestured toward the building. "Mr. Donovan gave me a key. Come on."

"Amy—"

"Now, Marcus."

There was steel in her voice I'd never heard before. The good girl, the patient tutor, was gone. This was someone who'd made a decision and wasn't backing down.

I followed her inside.

The library was dark and cool and quiet, none of the usual buzz of patrons and activity. Amy led me past the front desk, past the reading room, all the way to the back study room we'd used for tutoring. She flipped on the light, walked inside, and closed the door behind us.

Then she turned to face me.

"What's going on?"

I looked away, focusing on the bookshelf behind her. "Nothing. I told you, I've just been busy—"

"Don't." Her voice was sharp enough to make me look back. "Don't lie to me. Not now. Not after everything."

"I'm not lying."

"You missed Thursday's session with a vague excuse. You avoided me all day Friday. You looked like you haven't slept in a week. And now it's Tuesday and you still look terrible and you won't even look me in the eye." She took a step closer. "Something is wrong, Marcus. And I'm not leaving this room until you tell me what."

My hands curled into fists at my sides. "It's nothing you need to worry about."

"That's not your call to make."

"Amy, just—just let it go, okay? I'm handling it."

"Handling what?"

I shook my head, jaw tight. Every instinct screamed at me to shut down, shut her out, protect her from this. From me.

"Marcus." Her voice softened slightly. "I thought we were friends. I thought we'd been honest with each other these past months. So why are you shutting me out now? What happened?"

The genuine hurt in her voice cracked something in my chest.

"You don't want to know," I said quietly. "Trust me."

"Yes, I do. That's why I'm here."

"It's not your problem."

"Then whose problem is it? Because it's clearly eating you alive."

I turned away from her, staring at the wall. My reflection stared back from the dark window—hollow-eyed and exhausted and trapped.

"I'm trying to protect you," I said finally.

"From what?"

"From me. From my past. From all the poison that follows guys like me around."

Silence. Then Amy's footsteps behind me, closer.

"Talk to me," she said softly. "Please."

And maybe it was the exhaustion, or the fear, or the fact that I was out of time and out of answers. Maybe it was because she was the only good thing in my life and I couldn't stand lying to her anymore.

Whatever it was, my defenses crumbled.

"Snake came to see me last Thursday," I said, voice rough. "After our session. He was waiting in the alley when I took out the trash."

I heard her sharp intake of breath. "Your old crew?"

"Yeah. He wants me to help with a job. Saturday night. Said the crew needs me." I laughed, bitter. "Said I owe them."

"You told him no."

"Of course I told him no. I'm done with that life. Done with the crew and the jobs and all of it." My hands were shaking. I shoved them in my pockets. "But Snake doesn't care what I want."

"What did he say?"

I closed my eyes. "He said if I don't show up Saturday, he'll make sure everyone knows you've been spending time with me. He'll talk to your parents, send photos to your college, spread rumors. He'll destroy your reputation just to prove a point."

The words hung in the air between us.

"He threatened me?" Amy's voice was strange—flat and controlled.

"He threatened your future. Your family. Everything you've worked for." I turned to face her. "Don't you get it? Being around me puts you at risk. My past, my history with the crew—it's all poison and it's going to drag you down if I let it."

"So you were going to—what? Just avoid me? Push me away? Not tell me someone threatened me?"

"I was trying to protect you."

"By making decisions for me without asking?" Her voice rose. "By treating me like I'm some fragile thing that can't handle the truth?"

"You are—" I stopped, searching for words. "You're good, Amy. You're smart and you're going to college and you have this whole bright future ahead of you. And I'm—I'm a guy with a record and a crew tattoo who's one mistake away from ending up in the same cell as my brother. You deserve better than getting dragged into my mess."

"That's not your choice to make."

"Someone has to protect you."

"From what? The truth?" She was angry now, truly angry. "I'm not some perfect princess who needs protecting, Marcus. I'm a person who can make my own decisions about who I spend time with and what risks I want to take. And you don't get to decide what's good for me."

"I'm trying to do the right thing."

"The right thing is being honest with me! The right thing is trusting me enough to tell me the truth and let me help figure it out instead of just shutting me out like I don't matter!"

"You do matter," I said, voice breaking. "You matter more than anything and that's why I can't let him hurt you."

Amy stopped, breathing hard. When she spoke again her voice was quieter but no less fierce. "What were you going to do? About Snake's ultimatum?"

I looked away.

"Marcus."

"I don't know," I admitted. "If I do the job I violate probation and go to prison. If I don't do it he destroys your life. There's no good choice."

"So you were just going to carry this alone? Avoid me until you made some decision and then what? Disappear?"

"I was trying to figure it out."

"By yourself. Without telling me. Without asking what I think about threats made against my own reputation." She shook her head. "Don't you see how messed up that is?"

I didn't have an answer for that.

Amy crossed her arms, thinking. "Have you talked to anyone? Mr. Donovan? Your probation officer?"

"And say what? Snake threatened me? There's no proof. It's his word against mine and guess whose word people in this town believe?"

"So you were just going to give up?"

"I wasn't giving up. I was trying to protect you."

"Stop saying that!" Her voice cracked. "Stop hiding behind protecting me when what you're really doing is protecting yourself from having to trust someone. From having to believe someone might actually care about you enough to want to help."

The words hit me like a fist to the gut.

"That's not—"

"Isn't it?" She stepped closer, eyes bright with anger and something that looked like tears. "You don't think you deserve good things. You don't think you deserve help or support or—or friendship. So the second things get hard you pull away and make the decision alone because that's safer than trusting someone, right? Safer than believing I might care what happens to you?"

I stared at her, throat tight.

"I thought we were past this," Amy said quietly. "I thought you knew by now that I see you, Marcus. Not the reputation, not the crew tattoo, not the record. You. The guy who studies for his GED because he wants to be better. The guy who shows up every day and works hard and reads Jack London and actually cares about things even though he pretends not to." Her voice softened. "The guy I've been spending every Tuesday and Thursday with because I want to, not because I have to."

"Amy—"

"Do you care about me?"

The question stopped me cold.

"What?"

"It's a simple question. Do you care about me? Yes or no?"

I looked at her standing there fierce and angry and beautiful, and I couldn't lie. Not anymore.

"Yes," I said hoarsely. "I care about you. More than I should. More than is smart."

"Then stop making decisions alone." She held my gaze. "Tell me what you want to do. Not what you think you have to do, not what protects me. What do you actually want?"

The honest answer came easier than I expected.

"I don't want to go back to the crew. I don't want to run Snake's job or be part of that life anymore." The words tumbled out. "But I don't see another choice that keeps you safe. And I can't—" My voice broke. "I can't let him hurt you, Amy. I can't."

She was quiet for a long moment. Then she nodded, like I'd confirmed something she already knew.

"Okay," she said. "Then we figure it out together. Not you alone trying to fall on your sword to save me. Together."

"There's nothing to figure out. Snake gave me until tonight—"

"What time tonight?"

"Eleven. At the depot."

"Then we have twelve hours." She pulled out a chair and sat down. "Sit. We're going to think this through."

"Amy, you don't understand. Snake isn't going to just forget about this. The crew doesn't let people walk away."

"I understand perfectly." Her voice was calm now, focused. "Snake threatened you. He's using me as leverage. And you've spent the last week trying to solve this by yourself and making yourself sick over it." She looked up at me. "But you're not alone anymore. So sit down and talk to me."

I sat.

Because what else was I going to do? I was out of time and out of ideas and she wasn't going to let me walk away.

And some small part of me—the part I'd been trying to ignore—was desperately glad she wasn't.

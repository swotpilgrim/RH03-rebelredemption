# Chapter 7: Careful Distance

Two weeks passed and Tuesday-Thursday became the rhythm my life moved to.

Monday-Wednesday-Friday I shelved books and swept floors and counted the hours until the next session. Tuesday and Thursday I showed up at table three at two o'clock sharp, sat across from Amy Parker, and pretended my heart didn't kick up every time she smiled.

We were making progress on the GED prep—that's what I told myself this was about. Progress. Education. Proving I could be more than a high school dropout.

Not about the way she tucked her hair behind her ear when she concentrated on explaining a concept. Not about how she smelled faintly of soap and something floral I couldn't identify. Not about the small scar on her chin I'd noticed that first real session, wondering what childhood accident had put it there.

Progress. That's all this was.

I was a terrible liar, even to myself.

Thursday afternoon, late June. Amy had brought short stories to analyze for reading comprehension.

"What did you think of 'To Build a Fire'?" she asked.

I'd read the Jack London story the night before. A man freezing to death in the Yukon because he didn't respect nature's power, didn't listen to warnings, thought he could survive alone.

"He was an idiot," I said.

Amy's eyebrows rose. "That's one interpretation."

"He had warnings. But he went anyway because he thought he knew better." I tapped the book. "Pride killed him."

"So the theme is about pride?"

I thought about it. "Pride and not listening. Thinking you don't need anyone else. He could've survived if he'd brought a partner or just admitted he wasn't tough enough."

Amy nodded, making notes. "Excellent analysis. What else?"

"Nature doesn't care about you. The cold wasn't evil—it just was. He tried to fight it instead of respecting it." The words came easier now, after weeks of these discussions. "London writes a lot about that. Nature being stronger than people who think they're above it."

"Have you been reading more London?" Amy's face lit up with that smile that made my chest tight.

I shrugged. "Checked out some of his other stuff. Between sessions."

"Which ones?"

"'White Fang.' Some of the Klondike stories. They're good."

The truth was I'd torn through everything by London the library had, reading late into the night. I'd forgotten how much I used to love reading, how stories could take you somewhere else.

Amy had reminded me.

"I'm glad," she said, and the warmth in her voice made me look away before I did something stupid.

---

The sessions had started ending later.

What was supposed to be an hour kept stretching to ninety minutes. We'd finish GED work and drift into talking about books. Amy never made me feel stupid for not knowing authors. Just recommended ones I might like.

"Try 'The Old Man and the Sea,'" she said one Tuesday, writing the title in my notebook. "It's short but powerful. About perseverance and dignity even when you're losing."

I took the book home that day and read it in one sitting. Came back Thursday ready to talk about Santiago and his respect for the fish, about fighting even when defeat was inevitable, about being destroyed but not defeated.

Amy listened to my rambling thoughts like they mattered. Like I was a real student, not just a project.

And that's when I knew I was in trouble.

---

I started noticing things I shouldn't.

The freckle on Amy's left wrist that showed when she pushed up her cardigan sleeves. How she hummed under her breath when she was working through a math problem, something classical I didn't recognize. The way her laugh was quiet—more of an exhale than a sound—when I said something that surprised her.

The way she'd look at me sometimes when I was working through a problem, her expression thoughtful, like she was figuring me out.

I noticed when other guys looked at her too.

Thursday afternoon Tommy Richards walked past our table—captain of the baseball team, headed to State in the fall, exactly the kind of guy a girl like Amy should be with. He slowed, smiled at her.

"Hey, Amy."

"Hi, Tommy." She glanced up briefly, polite smile in place, then back to the textbook we were working through. "How's your summer?"

"Good. Real good. Hey, some of us are going to the drive-in Saturday. You should come."

"Thanks, but I'm busy."

"Another time then." He looked at me for half a second—the kind of dismissive glance that said I wasn't worth acknowledging—and walked on.

Something hot and uncomfortable twisted in my gut.

Jealousy. I was jealous of Tommy fucking Richards, who probably didn't even know what the Dewey Decimal System was, who'd never had to fight for anything in his whole charmed life.

"Marcus?"

I looked up. Amy was watching me, her expression concerned.

"You okay? You looked upset."

"I'm fine." I forced myself to focus on the page in front of me. "What were we working on?"

She studied me for another second before returning to the lesson, but I felt her awareness of me shift slightly. Like she'd noticed something.

I needed to be more careful.

---

After every session I left immediately.

No lingering at the table while Amy packed up her materials. No walking out together. No standing on the library steps making small talk like we were friends instead of tutor and student.

Because that's all we were. All we could be.

She was Amy Parker, hardware store royalty, college-bound, everything right and good about Riverside. I was Marcus Webb, ex-crew member with a record, barely scratching my way toward a GED.

We existed in the same space twice a week because Mr. Donovan had arranged it and because Amy was too nice to say no to helping someone who needed it. That was all.

The fact that I looked forward to Tuesdays and Thursdays more than I'd looked forward to anything in years didn't change the fundamental truth: she was off-limits.

So I kept my distance. Stayed professional. Focused on the work.

And tried not to think about how her smile made something in my chest feel too big for my ribs.

Friday afternoon, finishing my shift, I was shelving in the biography section when I overheard Amy with another tutoring student—a girl from the high school, maybe a sophomore.

"How do you stay so patient?" the girl was asking. "I'd get frustrated if my student didn't get it."

"Everyone learns differently." Amy's voice carried that calm certainty I'd gotten used to. "Some people just need concepts explained a different way, or more time to process. That doesn't mean they can't learn."

"I guess. But like, that guy you're working with. The one with community service. Isn't it hard teaching someone who dropped out?"

I froze, book in hand, waiting for Amy's response.

"Marcus is one of my best students." Her voice had an edge I'd never heard before. Steel underneath the softness. "He works harder than most people I've tutored, and he's actually engaged with the material instead of just going through the motions. The fact that he dropped out says more about the school system failing him than him failing."

Silence.

"Oh," the girl said quietly. "I didn't mean—"

"I know. But maybe don't assume things about people you don't know."

I stood there in the biography section, Jack London's autobiography clutched in my hands, trying to process what I'd just heard.

Amy had defended me. Not just politely deflected—actually defended me. Called me one of her best students. Said the system failed me.

Like she actually believed it.

Like she actually cared.

That was dangerous. Dangerous for her, because caring about guys like me only brought trouble. And dangerous for me, because it made the careful distance I was trying to maintain feel impossible.

I shelved the book and got out of that aisle before anyone could see the look on my face.

---

That night I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep despite the heat.

One of her best students. The system failed him.

The words played on repeat, mixing with memories of her smile, her patience, the way she'd handed me "The Call of the Wild" like a gift.

I was falling for her.

Not the surface attraction I'd felt that first day seeing her tutor in the library. Real falling—the kind that scared the hell out of me because I didn't know how to stop it, didn't know how to protect myself from the inevitable crash when she realized I wasn't worth the effort.

Girls like Amy didn't end up with guys like me. They married Tommy Richards types and moved to nice houses north of the tracks and had respectable lives with respectable kids who never ended up in front of Judge Harrison.

I was a phase. A charity project. The guy she tutored one summer before heading off to college and never thinking about again.

That's what I told myself.

But late at night, when I couldn't lie anymore, I admitted the truth: I was in too deep to protect myself. Amy Parker had gotten past every defense I had, and I didn't even know when it had happened.

Somewhere between that first session and now, she'd stopped being my tutor and become the person I thought about first thing in the morning and last thing at night.

The person I wanted to be better for.

The person I was terrified of losing even though I'd never really had her to begin with.

---

Tuesday came around again. I showed up at two o'clock to find Amy already at table three, setting up for our session.

She looked up when I sat down and smiled, and the careful distance I'd been maintaining crumbled a little more.

"Ready to tackle algebra?" she asked.

No. I wasn't ready for algebra. I wasn't ready for any of this—not the way my heart sped up when she smiled, not the way I hung on every word she said, not the way I'd started imagining impossible futures where a guy like me could matter to a girl like her.

But I opened my notebook and said, "Yeah, let's do it."

And for the next ninety minutes I sat across from Amy Parker and pretended I wasn't completely, hopelessly falling for her.

Pretended this was just about education.

Pretended I could keep my distance.

Pretended my heart wasn't a ticking time bomb waiting to destroy me when she inevitably walked away.

But late that night, sitting on my porch with the latest Jack London book, I stopped pretending and admitted the truth, if only to myself:

I was in love with her.

And I was absolutely fucked.

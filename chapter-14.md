# Chapter 14: Town Talk

Riverside was a small town, and small towns talked.

I'd always known that. Had felt the weight of gossip my whole life—whispers about the Webb family, about Danny and his trouble, about me following in his footsteps. But I'd learned to ignore it, to let the words slide off without sticking.

This was different.

This was about Amy.

Thursday I stopped at Mel's Diner after my shift, needing coffee before heading home. The place was half-full—usual afternoon crowd of retirees and shift workers grabbing early dinner.

Conversations stopped when I walked in.

Not obviously. Not dramatically. Just that subtle shift where people's voices dropped, where eyes tracked my movement to the counter, where the easy chatter became something more guarded.

I ordered coffee from Betty, the waitress who'd worked at Mel's since before I was born. She gave me a look that wasn't quite friendly but wasn't hostile either—just assessing.

"Heard you're spending time at the library," she said, pouring coffee into a chipped mug. "Getting your GED."

"Yes, ma'am."

"Good for you, Marcus. About time one of the Webb boys made something of themselves." She set the mug in front of me. "Though you might want to be careful about the company you keep while you're there."

The words were casual but the meaning was clear.

People were noticing me and Amy.

I paid for the coffee and left without drinking it.

Friday afternoon I stopped at Carter's Gas Station to fill Lazarus's tank. Mr. Carter himself was working the pumps, a man in his sixties who'd run the station since the Korean War ended.

"That'll be two dollars even," he said when the pump clicked off.

I handed him the bills.

"Saw you at the library the other day," Carter said, pocketing the money. "You and the Parker girl looked mighty cozy on those steps."

My jaw tightened. "We were just talking."

"I'm sure you were." His tone suggested he thought otherwise. "Just seems strange, is all. Good girl like that spending so much time with..." He trailed off meaningfully.

"With what?" The words came out harder than I intended.

Carter's eyes went flat. "With someone from your side of the tracks. Girl like Amy Parker has prospects. Future. Wouldn't want to see her throw that away on some summer thing that can't go anywhere."

I wanted to hit him. Wanted to grab his collar and ask him who the hell he thought he was, judging me based on where I lived, who my brother was, mistakes I'd made when I was sixteen.

Instead I got in my truck and left, hands shaking on the wheel.

Monday morning I had my weekly check-in with Officer Garrett.

I'd been showing up to these appointments for three months now, watching Garrett's skepticism slowly fade into grudging acceptance that I was actually complying with the court's orders. Today felt different.

"Sit down, Marcus." Garrett gestured to the chair across from his desk.

I sat.

He studied me for a long moment before speaking. "You've been doing well with your community service. Donovan gives you good reports. Says you're reliable, hardworking, respectful."

"Yes, sir."

"Also says you're making real progress on your GED work. That you're studying outside your tutoring sessions. That's good."

"Thank you, sir."

Garrett leaned back in his chair. "Who's tutoring you?"

The question felt like a trap. "Amy Parker. Mr. Donovan arranged it."

"Amy Parker." Garrett repeated the name slowly. "The hardware store family?"

"Yes, sir."

"How much time do you spend with her? In these tutoring sessions?"

"Two hours a week. Tuesday and Thursday afternoons."

"Just two hours?" Garrett's tone suggested he knew otherwise. "Because I've been hearing interesting things around town. About you and the Parker girl spending considerable time together. Talking on library steps. Looking... close."

Rage simmered under my skin but I kept my voice level. "We're student and tutor. That's all."

"Is it?" Garrett leaned forward. "Because if you're using your community service as an opportunity to pursue an inappropriate relationship with a minor—"

"She's seventeen. I'm eighteen. And we're not—" I stopped, fists clenched under the desk. "We're just studying."

"Make sure it stays that way." Garrett's voice went cold. "You're on thin ice, Marcus. One complaint, one inappropriate action, and you're done. Adult court, adult consequences. You understand?"

"Yes, sir."

"Good. Now get out of my office."

I left feeling like I'd been punched in the gut.

Tuesday's session was tense.

Not because of anything between me and Amy—that was the same as always, easy and comfortable despite everything happening outside table three.

But Mrs. Parker was there.

She'd shown up at the library around one-thirty and had been "volunteering" at the circulation desk ever since, organizing returned books and helping patrons while keeping constant watch on our table.

Amy noticed immediately. Her smile when I sat down was strained, her shoulders tight.

"My mom's been coming here more," she said quietly. "Watching us."

"I noticed."

"She's asking questions." Amy kept her voice low. "About how long our sessions run. Whether we're actually studying or just talking. Whether I still need to tutor you now that you're doing better."

The implication was clear: Mrs. Parker was looking for reasons to end this.

"What did you tell her?" I asked.

"That you're making excellent progress and still need the tutoring. That Mr. Donovan asked me to work with you through the end of your community service." Amy met my eyes. "That I'm not stopping."

"Maybe you should."

The words came out before I could stop them.

Amy's expression went sharp. "What?"

"Your mother's right. People are talking. It's affecting your reputation—"

"I don't care about my reputation."

"You should." I leaned closer, voice urgent. "You have college applications coming up. Letters of recommendation. A future. Being associated with me could ruin all of that."

"Or it could show I care about more than just maintaining appearances." Amy's voice had an edge I'd never heard. "That I'm willing to help someone who actually wants help instead of just tutoring kids whose parents think it looks good for college."

"Amy—"

"No. You don't get to make this decision for me." Her eyes flashed. "Everyone else is trying to tell me what to do, who to spend time with, what's appropriate. I thought you were different."

"I'm trying to protect you."

"I don't need protecting. I need you to keep showing up and let me make my own choices."

Across the library, Mrs. Parker was watching us intently.

We went back to studying, but the conversation hung heavy between us.

---

Thursday Mrs. Parker was there again. And Friday. And Monday.

Every time I was at the library, she was there too. Not interfering directly—she was too smart for that. Just present. Watching. Making sure Amy knew she was being monitored.

Making sure I knew I was on borrowed time.

---

Wednesday I was shelving when I overheard two women talking in the next aisle.

"—shame, really. That Parker girl seemed like such a good kid."

"She is a good kid. Just making bad choices. You know how teenage girls get about bad boys."

"But the Webb kid? With his record? What's she thinking?"

"She's not thinking. That's the problem. Linda Parker must be beside herself."

"I would be too if my daughter was throwing herself away on someone like that. He'll end up in prison just like his brother, mark my words."

"And she'll be left with a ruined reputation and no prospects. Such a waste."

I stood frozen in the stacks, book in hand, listening to them dissect Amy's life and my worthiness like it was casual conversation.

This was what I'd been afraid of. What I'd known would happen.

Amy being with me—even just being seen with me—was destroying her reputation in Riverside. People were talking, judging, assuming the worst.

And there was nothing I could do to stop it except walk away.

---

Thursday's session Amy looked exhausted.

"My mother had a talk with Mr. Donovan," she said quietly. "Asked him if the tutoring arrangement was really necessary. Whether it might be better for another volunteer to take over."

My stomach dropped. "What did he say?"

"That I'm an excellent tutor and you're making strong progress, and he sees no reason to change what's working." Amy smiled slightly. "He also said that who I choose to tutor is my decision as a volunteer, not hers as a concerned parent."

"She's not going to stop."

"No. She's not." Amy met my eyes. "But neither am I."

"Amy, listen—"

"I know what people are saying." Her voice was steady. "I'm not deaf. I hear the whispers. See the looks. My mother's made sure I know exactly how the town views my association with you."

"Then why—"

"Because they're wrong." Simple. Direct. "They're wrong about you. And I'm tired of letting other people's judgments dictate my choices."

I wanted to believe her. Wanted to accept that she could withstand the pressure, the gossip, the slow erosion of her reputation.

But I knew Riverside. Knew how small-town judgment worked. Once you were labeled, the label stuck.

And Amy was being labeled as the good girl who'd fallen for the wrong guy.

Because of me.

---

Friday night I lay in bed thinking about impossible choices.

I could keep showing up, keep tutoring, keep stealing moments with Amy while her reputation crumbled and people whispered about what a shame it was.

Or I could walk away. Tell her I was done with tutoring, that I'd work on my GED alone, that she should focus on her college applications and forget about the Webb kid who'd briefly crossed her path one summer.

The noble thing would be walking away.

The selfish thing was what I wanted: to keep showing up, keep falling deeper, keep pretending this could lead somewhere good.

I didn't sleep much that night.

But when Tuesday came around, I was at table three at 1:55.

Amy was already there, waiting.

Mrs. Parker was at the circulation desk, watching.

The whole town was probably talking.

And I didn't care.

Because Amy had chosen to be here.

Had chosen me, despite everything.

And I'd be damned if I'd walk away from that just because Riverside disapproved.

Let them talk.

Let them judge.

Let them whisper about the Parker girl and the Webb boy and how it would never work.

We'd prove them wrong.

Or we'd fail trying.

Either way, I was done letting other people's expectations control my life.

I sat down next to Amy and we got to work.

And if Mrs. Parker's expression went colder, if the town talked louder, if the judgment got heavier—

We'd face it together.

# Chapter 12: Small Moments

August settled over Riverside like a weight, heat radiating off pavement and turning the air thick as syrup.

The library became a refuge. Cool air conditioning, quiet spaces, and twice a week the chance to sit across from Amy and pretend the outside world didn't exist.

Except we weren't sitting across from each other anymore.

After that Tuesday when Amy had sat next to me instead of opposite, when she'd said she chose to be here, we'd stayed that way. Side by side at table three, shoulders sometimes almost touching when we bent over the same textbook, close enough that I could smell her soap and whatever floral scent she wore.

Close enough to drive me slowly insane.

Our sessions had started stretching longer too. What was supposed to be an hour kept becoming seventy-five minutes, ninety, sometimes two hours if the library wasn't busy and Amy didn't have somewhere else to be.

We'd finish GED work and drift into talking about other things. Books, mostly—Amy bringing novels she thought I'd like, me sharing what I'd read that week.

"Have you ever read Fitzgerald?" she asked one Tuesday, pulling a slim volume from her bag. "The Great Gatsby?"

"No."

"It's about a man trying to become someone he's not. To be worthy of the woman he loves." She slid the book toward me. "I think you'd connect with it."

I took the book, our fingers brushing. The contact lasted maybe a second but I felt it like electricity.

"You think I'm trying to become someone I'm not?" I asked.

Amy's expression turned thoughtful. "I think you're trying to become who you already are underneath. There's a difference."

Thursday afternoon, mid-August. The heat had driven most patrons away, leaving the library nearly empty.

Amy and I worked through practice essay questions, and I found myself watching her more than the page in front of me.

The way she tucked hair behind her ear when concentrating—always the left side, never the right. How she had a small freckle on her left wrist that showed when she pushed up her cardigan sleeves. The way she hummed under her breath when working through a problem, some classical piece I didn't recognize but had started to associate with her completely.

"You're staring," she said without looking up.

Heat flooded my face. "Sorry."

"I didn't say to stop." She glanced at me, a small smile playing at her lips. "Just observing."

My heart did something complicated.

We went back to the essays, but I caught her looking at me too a few minutes later, and something warm settled in my chest.

---

The sessions weren't just longer. They were different—boundaries that had existed between tutor and student blurring into something I didn't have a name for.

Friends felt too small for what was happening. But anything more felt too dangerous to acknowledge out loud.

So we existed in this in-between space, talking about books and equations and everything except what was actually happening between us.

On Tuesday Amy brought me three new novels based on books I'd mentioned liking. On Thursday I showed her an essay I'd written about "The Great Gatsby" without her assigning it, just because I'd wanted to talk about it with her.

"This is really good," she said, reading my analysis of Gatsby's impossible dream. "You understand the tragedy of wanting something you can never have."

"Yeah," I said quietly. "I understand that."

Our eyes met and held for a beat too long before Amy looked away, cheeks slightly pink.

---

Thursday afternoon, late August. Our session ended at three-thirty but neither of us moved to leave.

"Your truck's been giving you trouble, right?" Amy asked. "You mentioned it wouldn't start the other day."

"Yeah. Battery's dying. Needs to be replaced but I haven't had the money yet."

"My dad sells batteries at the hardware store. I could ask him for the employee discount—"

"No." The word came out too fast. "I mean, thank you. But I can handle it."

I couldn't take charity from the Parkers. Couldn't give Mrs. Parker more ammunition about the poor kid from south of the tracks who couldn't even keep his truck running.

Amy studied me for a second, then nodded. "Okay. But the offer stands."

We packed up our materials slowly, neither of us in a hurry to end the afternoon. When we finally headed toward the exit, walking side by side through the quiet library, it felt significant somehow. Like we were crossing an invisible line just by leaving together.

The marble steps outside were hot from hours of sun. A few people walked past on Main Street, but the heat had driven most folks indoors.

"My mom's running late," Amy said, checking her watch. "She said she'd be here at four."

"I can wait with you. If you want."

"I'd like that."

So we stood on the library steps in the heat, and for the first time we were just Marcus and Amy instead of student and tutor. Just two people talking.

"How's your studying going?" she asked. "Outside our sessions?"

"Good. Been working through practice tests every night. Math is starting to make sense finally."

"That's because you're actually trying now. Before you were just going through the motions."

"What changed?" I knew the answer but wanted to hear what she thought.

Amy considered. "I think you found something worth working for."

"Yeah," I said quietly. "I did."

We fell into comfortable silence. A breeze kicked up, offering brief relief from the heat. Amy lifted her face to it, eyes closing, and I memorized the moment—the angle of her jaw, the way afternoon light caught in her hair, the small smile on her lips.

"Your truck," she said, eyes still closed. "How bad is it really?"

"It's temperamental. Sometimes starts on the first try, sometimes takes three or four."

"Do you talk to it? My grandpa used to say his old truck responded better to sweet talk than cursing."

I laughed. "I've tried both. Neither works consistently."

Amy opened her eyes and grinned. "Maybe it needs a name."

"A name?"

"Sure. Everything runs better with a name."

"What would I even name a beat-up '51 Ford that sounds like it's dying every time I turn the key?"

"Hmm." Amy tapped her chin, pretending to think seriously. "Lazarus? Since it keeps coming back from the dead?"

The unexpected joke surprised a real laugh out of me. "Lazarus the truck. That's terrible."

"You have a better idea?"

"No," I admitted, still grinning. "Lazarus it is."

Amy laughed—that quiet exhale that was more breath than sound—and I thought I'd do anything to keep making her laugh like that. Would name my truck whatever ridiculous thing she suggested, would read any book she recommended, would become whoever she needed me to be if it meant more moments like this.

"There's my mom," Amy said, the laughter fading from her voice.

I looked up. The cream-colored Buick was pulling to the curb, Mrs. Parker behind the wheel.

Even from the steps I could see her expression go cold when she saw us together. Saw her daughter laughing with the Webb boy on the library steps like we were friends. Like we belonged in the same world.

Amy's posture changed—subtle but noticeable. The easy warmth from seconds ago pulling back into something more guarded.

"I should go," she said.

"Yeah."

But she didn't move immediately. Just looked at me for a second, and something passed between us that I couldn't quite name.

"Same time Tuesday?" she asked.

"Same time Tuesday."

Amy walked down the steps toward the car. Mrs. Parker was watching us through the windshield, disapproval radiating from her in waves.

I stayed on the steps, hands in my pockets, and watched Amy slide into the passenger seat.

Through the window I saw Mrs. Parker say something sharp. Saw Amy's jaw tighten, her hands gesturing as she responded. The argument was clear even without hearing words—Mrs. Parker angry that Amy was spending time with me, Amy defending... what? Her right to tutor whoever she wanted? Or something more?

The Buick pulled away from the curb, taking Amy with it.

I walked to my truck—to Lazarus, apparently—and climbed in.

The engine turned over on the third try.

That night I couldn't stop thinking about the library steps.

About standing with Amy in the heat, talking about nothing. About her laugh and the way she'd named my truck.

About how those small moments had become the most important parts of my week.

I was falling deeper every day.

And Mrs. Parker knew it.

That was the dangerous part. Not the falling—I was already gone. But that other people were noticing. That Amy's mother was watching with increasing hostility, seeing what I'd tried to hide.

That we mattered to each other beyond tutoring.

I pulled out my notebook and wrote an essay about small moments. About quiet times mattering more than big gestures. About finding connection in unexpected places.

About falling in love in increments so small you didn't notice until you were drowning.

Tuesday came around like it always did.

I showed up at 1:55. Amy was already there, organizing materials.

When I sat down she smiled, and the whole world condensed to that single point—her smile, this table, the space between us that felt smaller every session.

"How's Lazarus?" she asked.

"Started on the second try this morning. I think the name's helping."

Her laugh was quiet but real.

And for ninety minutes we worked through geometry problems and discussed "The Great Gatsby" and existed in our small, perfect bubble where the outside world couldn't touch us.

But when the session ended and I walked to my truck, I saw Mrs. Parker's Buick parked across the street.

She was early. Watching. Making sure she saw exactly how long Amy stayed, how we looked at each other, how reluctant we were to say goodbye.

Making sure Amy knew she was being watched.

The message was clear: this had to stop.

I drove home thinking about impossible things.

About how small moments added up to something bigger than their parts. About how falling in love with Amy Parker was the best and worst thing that had ever happened to me.

And about how Mrs. Parker's disapproval was about to make everything infinitely more complicated.

But as I pulled into my driveway and killed the engine, I realized something:

I didn't care.

Let Mrs. Parker disapprove. Let the whole town talk. Let them all think I wasn't good enough for Amy.

I was going to keep showing up. Keep trying. Keep fighting for every small moment I could steal.

Because those moments with Amy?

They were worth anything.

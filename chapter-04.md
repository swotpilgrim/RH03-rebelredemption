# Chapter 4: Unexpected Assignment

I was shelving in the reference section Thursday afternoon when Donovan found me.

"Marcus. My office, please."

My stomach dropped.

That tone—calm, neutral, giving nothing away—was the same one principals used before they expelled you. The same one cops used before they put you in handcuffs. I ran through everything I might have done wrong in the past three weeks. Mis-shelved books? Probably, but nothing major. Talked back to a patron? No. Showed up late? Not once.

Still, I followed Donovan through the staff area to his office, my mind running through worst-case scenarios. Judge Harrison had said zero tolerance. One mistake and I'd be in adult court facing real time.

Donovan gestured to the chair across from his desk. "Sit."

I sat, keeping my expression carefully blank. Whatever was coming, I wouldn't give him the satisfaction of seeing me rattled.

He settled into his own chair and studied me for a long moment. Through the window behind him I could see Main Street, normal people going about their normal lives, unaware that mine might be ending.

"You've been here almost three weeks," Donovan said finally.

"Yes, sir."

"How do you find the work?"

The question caught me off guard. "Fine, sir."

"Your attendance has been perfect. You're on time, you do what's asked without complaint, and you handle the materials carefully." He paused. "I've also noticed you reading."

Heat crept up my neck. I hadn't thought anyone was paying attention to the way I sometimes lingered over book covers while shelving, or how I'd flip through pages when I thought no one was watching.

"Just the covers mostly," I said. "Helps me remember where things go."

"Mm." Donovan didn't look convinced. "Tell me, Marcus. Did you finish high school?"

The question hit like a fist to the gut. I stared at him, trying to figure out where this was going, what the right answer was supposed to be.

"No, sir."

"When did you leave?"

"Junior year." The words tasted like failure. "About two years ago."

"Why?"

Because school was a prison where teachers looked at me like I'd already failed. Because the crew had made me feel like I belonged and school had only ever made me feel stupid.

But I couldn't say any of that to a man who clearly valued education.

"Wasn't for me," I said instead.

Donovan leaned back in his chair. "That's a shame. From what I've observed, you're intelligent enough. Good with patterns, quick to learn the shelving system, able to follow complex instructions. Those aren't qualities of someone who can't handle academic work."

I didn't know what to say to that, so I said nothing.

"Community service is meant to be punitive," Donovan continued. "But I've always believed it should also be an opportunity for growth. You're required to be here for two hundred hours regardless. The question is whether those hours simply pass, or whether they're used to build toward something."

My hands tightened on the armrests. "I don't understand, sir."

"I'm offering you a chance to work toward your GED while you're completing your service hours."

The words hung in the air between us. GED. General Education Development. The thing people got when they'd screwed up too badly to finish high school the normal way. The thing that might actually let me apply for decent jobs instead of just construction labor and garage work.

"We have volunteers who tutor through our adult literacy program," Donovan went on. "Amy Parker is one of our best. She works with students of all ages on a variety of subjects. I've spoken with her, and she's willing to work with you twice weekly—Tuesdays and Thursdays, after your shift ends. An hour each session."

Amy Parker.

The name hit me like ice water. The girl with the patient smile and the pearl earrings and the mother who looked at me like I was trash. The girl I'd been carefully not thinking about, not watching, not wanting.

"I can't—" I started.

"Can't what?" Donovan's expression didn't change. "Can't accept educational help? Can't take advantage of an opportunity most people in your position would jump at?"

"I just—" How did I explain that sitting across from Amy Parker while she witnessed exactly how far behind I was academically sounded worse than jail? "I don't want to waste her time."

"Amy doesn't consider education a waste of time. Neither do I." Donovan folded his hands on his desk. "You have a choice, Marcus. You can shelve books for four months and walk away exactly as you arrived—high school dropout, limited options, heading nowhere in particular. Or you can use this time to work toward something better."

"What if I'm not smart enough?" The words came out before I could stop them, raw and honest in a way that made me want to take them back.

Donovan's expression softened slightly. "Intelligence isn't your problem. You proved that when you learned our cataloging system in three days, a task that takes most volunteers two weeks. Your problem is believing you're not smart enough."

I looked at my hands. Callused from construction work, scarred from a dozen stupid fights, tattoo just visible beneath my pushed-up sleeve. These weren't the hands of someone who went to college or got a good education. These were the hands of a Webb, and Webbs didn't get second chances.

Except maybe this was one.

"The sessions would be completely voluntary on your part," Donovan said. "No one's forcing you. But if you choose to participate, I expect you to take it seriously. Show up on time, do the work, treat Amy's time with respect. Understood?"

I met his eyes. He was giving me a chance—an actual chance—to be something more than the sum of my worst mistakes. And yeah, it meant sitting across from a girl who'd see exactly how much I'd screwed up my life, but maybe that was the price of trying to fix it.

"Yes, sir. I'll do it."

"Good." Donovan made a note on a paper. "First session is next Tuesday at two o'clock. Amy will have assessment materials to determine where you're at academically. Come prepared to work."

"Yes, sir."

"And Marcus?" Donovan looked up. "This opportunity exists because I believe everyone deserves a chance to prove they're more than their mistakes. Don't make me regret extending it."

The weight of that settled on my shoulders like a physical thing. "I won't, sir."

I finished my shift in a daze, shelving books on autopilot while my mind spun.

GED tutoring. With Amy Parker. Twice a week.

Part of me wanted to go back to Donovan and tell him I'd changed my mind, that I couldn't do this, that sitting with a girl who probably had perfect grades and college acceptance letters while I struggled through basic math was humiliation I didn't need.

But a bigger part—the part that had lain awake at night in my cell after the judge's first warning wondering if this was all my life would ever be—knew Donovan was right. This was a chance. Maybe the only one I'd get.

I could take it or waste it, but I couldn't pretend it wasn't being offered.

At two o'clock I clocked out and headed for the door. As I passed through the main reading room I saw her—Amy, sitting at her usual table with a middle-school kid, patiently working through what looked like a reading comprehension worksheet.

She glanced up as I walked past.

Our eyes met for half a second and she gave that small smile, the one that seemed to say she saw me as a person instead of a problem.

Then I was out the door and down the marble steps to my truck.

Tuesday. Two o'clock. First tutoring session.

Four days to prepare myself for the humiliation of showing Amy Parker exactly how badly I'd failed at basic education.

Four days to accept that this was happening whether I was ready for it or not.

At home that evening Mom was in the kitchen making dinner—fried potatoes and the last of Sunday's pork chops, stretched thin to cover two nights' meals. She looked up when I came in, her expression the careful neutral she'd worn since Danny got arrested.

"How was work?"

"Fine." I washed my hands at the sink, then leaned against the counter. "Mr. Donovan offered me something today."

She turned from the stove. "What kind of something?"

"GED tutoring. There's a volunteer at the library who teaches. He set it up."

Mom's hands stilled on the spatula. "GED?"

"Yeah. Twice a week, after my shift. If I want to."

She studied my face, searching for something. Hope, maybe. Or evidence this was real and not just another promise I'd break.

"You want to?" she asked quietly.

Did I? Want felt like the wrong word. I was terrified of sitting in front of Amy Parker and proving every low expectation anyone had ever had of me. Terrified of trying and failing, of working toward something and coming up short like I always did.

But I was more terrified of being forty years old and still living south of the tracks with nothing to show for my life but a criminal record and regrets.

"Yeah," I said. "I think I do."

Something shifted in Mom's expression—not quite hope, but maybe the fragile beginning of it. "That's good, Marcus. That's real good."

She turned back to the stove but her shoulders had loosened slightly, like she'd been carrying weight and had just set a bit of it down.

We ate dinner in companionable silence. After, I cleared the table while Mom washed dishes, and when I went to my room I pulled out the old notebook I'd used sophomore year—pages half-filled with assignments I'd never completed, margins covered with doodles and frustrated scribbles.

I flipped to a clean page and stared at it.

Tuesday at two o'clock I'd sit across from Amy Parker and take my first real step toward proving I was more than a Webb from south of the tracks.

The thought was terrifying.

But I'd faced down Snake Morrison in dark alleys and Judge Harrison in court. I could face one good girl with a patient smile and a stack of textbooks.

I had to.

Because the alternative was staying exactly who I was right now, and that person didn't have much of a future.

I closed the notebook and stared at Danny's empty room across the hall.

This was my chance to not end up in the cell next to his.

And I was going to take it, even if it killed me.

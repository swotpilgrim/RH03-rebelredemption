# Chapter 11: Worth Fighting For

Wednesday night I couldn't sleep, but this time for different reasons.

Instead of lying in bed, I sat at the kitchen table with my notebook and GED practice tests from the library.

If I was falling for Amy Parker—and I was, completely—then I needed to be worthy of her.

That meant actually earning my GED. Not just going through the motions but really learning, really trying.

The math section made my brain hurt. Quadratic equations and geometry proofs that seemed designed to make me feel stupid. But I worked through them methodically, checking answers, going over mistakes until I understood where I'd messed up.

Midnight came and went. One o'clock.

I was halfway through a reading passage when I heard Mom's car.

She came in through the kitchen, stopping when she saw me at the table surrounded by papers and textbooks.

"You're up late," she said.

"Studying."

She set her purse on the counter, studying me with tired eyes. "For your GED?"

"Yeah."

Mom crossed to the refrigerator, pulled out the pitcher of water, poured herself a glass. I waited for her to say something—lecture me about wasting electricity, tell me studying was pointless, remind me that Webbs didn't go to college so why bother.

Instead she just stood there drinking her water.

"That Parker girl," she said finally. "The one tutoring you. She's good at it?"

"Yeah. She's... yeah. She's really good."

"And you're actually learning? Not just showing up because the judge said to?"

The question should have stung. But Mom had earned her skepticism. I'd disappointed her enough times to justify a lifetime of doubt.

"I'm actually learning," I said. "I want to take the test. Want to pass it."

Mom was quiet for a long moment. When she spoke, her voice was soft.

"Why now? What changed?"

Everything. Amy changed everything. But I couldn't say that—couldn't explain that falling in love with someone who believed in me had made me want to believe in myself.

"I don't want to be like Danny," I said instead. "Don't want to end up in a cell wondering where I went wrong. Want to prove I can be something more than what everyone expects."

Mom's eyes went shiny. She set down her glass and came around the table, putting her hand on my shoulder.

"You be careful with hope, Marcus. It's a dangerous thing."

"I know."

"I can't..." She trailed off, swallowed hard. "I can't watch you fail again. Can't take seeing you try and fall short."

The words cut deep, but I understood them. I'd given her plenty of reasons to expect failure.

"I'm not going to fail," I said, meeting her eyes. "Not this time."

She squeezed my shoulder once, then let go. "Get some sleep. You can study tomorrow."

After she went to bed I sat there for another hour, working through practice tests until my eyes burned and the numbers swam together.

But for the first time in years, I felt something that might have been hope.

Thursday afternoon I showed up at table three at 1:55.

Amy was already there, setting up materials. She smiled when I sat down.

"You're early."

"So are you."

"I like being prepared." She slid a worksheet toward me. "How's your week been?"

Better. Terrifying. Confusing. Perfect.

"Good," I said. "Been studying."

Her eyebrows rose. "Outside of our sessions?"

"Yeah. Practice tests mostly. Reading comprehension, math, some science."

The smile that spread across her face made my chest tight. "Marcus, that's wonderful. That's exactly what you should be doing."

We worked through algebra problems for the first half hour, and Amy kept glancing at me with this expression that was part pride, part surprise.

"You're really getting this," she said when I solved a particularly complicated equation correctly on the first try. "Like, really getting it."

"Had a good teacher."

"You're putting in the work. That's what makes the difference."

I met her eyes. "I want to prove I'm more than my past. More than the stupid mistakes I made when I was younger."

Amy's expression softened. "Marcus—"

"I know what people think. The Webb kid, gang member, dropout. But I want to show everyone—show myself—that I can be something more than that."

For a second neither of us said anything. Then Amy reached across the table and touched my hand—just briefly, her fingers resting on mine for maybe three seconds before she pulled back.

"You already are," she said quietly. "You're already proving that every day you show up. Every lesson you work through. Every time you choose to keep trying instead of giving up."

The touch lingered long after her hand was gone. I could still feel the warmth of her fingers, the certainty in her words.

"Thank you," I managed.

"For what?"

"For seeing something worth teaching."

Amy smiled. "Thank you for proving me right."

The rest of the session flew by. We covered material I'd struggled with last week and it actually made sense now. Amy's patient explanations combined with my late-night studying were clicking into place, forming understanding where there'd only been confusion before.

At three-thirty Amy packed up her materials but lingered at the table.

"Can I ask you something?" she said.

"Yeah."

"What made you decide to really commit to this? To the GED work?"

You, I thought. Falling for you made me want to be worthy of you.

But I couldn't say that. Not yet. Not when I had no idea if she felt even a fraction of what I was feeling.

"Got tired of being who everyone expected me to be," I said instead. "Figured it was time to become who I want to be."

"And who's that?"

I thought about it. "Someone better. Someone who has options. Someone who... someone worth believing in."

Amy studied me with those clear eyes that saw too much. "You're already someone worth believing in."

"Maybe. But I want to earn it, not just have you take it on faith."

"That's what makes you worth it, Marcus. That you care about earning it."

Friday my library shift felt different.

Same shelving work, same quiet atmosphere, same suspicious looks. But I moved through it with new purpose. This wasn't just serving time. This was building something better.

When I passed Amy in the stacks she gave me that small smile. The one that felt like a secret between us.

My heart did something complicated.

After my shift I sat in my truck thinking.

Three months ago I'd walked up those library steps expecting punishment.

Instead I'd found Amy. And through her, the possibility of being someone different.

That night I studied again. Math, reading, essay practice. I wrote about transformation—how people could change if they wanted it badly enough.

I had reason now. Amy was my reason.

Even if she never felt the same, she'd given me something no one else had: the belief I could be more than my worst moments.

Saturday morning I was on the porch reading when Danny's letter arrived.

Mom handed it to me without comment, then went back inside. Letters from county jail came every few weeks—Danny's cramped handwriting filling pages with complaints about the food, about his cellmate, about how unfair the system was.

I almost didn't open it. Almost threw it away unread.

But he was still my brother.

The letter was short:

*Marcus,*

*Mom says you're doing library service and getting your GED. Says you're staying clean, not running with the crew.*

*Good for you, little brother. Seriously. Don't end up in here with me.*

*Snake wrote me. Says you're causing problems, not being loyal. Says the crew needs to handle it.*

*I told him to leave you alone. Told him you're out, you're done. Don't know if he'll listen.*

*Be careful. Snake doesn't like people walking away. Makes him look weak.*

*I'm proud of you for trying. Don't screw it up.*

*Danny*

I read it three times, trying to parse the meaning underneath the words.

Danny had told Snake to leave me alone. But Snake wouldn't listen—I already knew that from his threats about Mom.

And Danny was proud of me.

That shouldn't have mattered. Danny's choices had nearly destroyed my life. But somehow knowing he wanted me to succeed, that he'd actually told the crew to back off...

It mattered.

I folded the letter carefully and put it in my pocket.

Then I went back to studying.

Sunday evening Mom caught me at the kitchen table again, surrounded by textbooks.

"You're going to burn yourself out," she said.

"I'm fine."

"Marcus." She sat down across from me. "I need you to understand something."

I looked up.

"I'm scared," she admitted. "Scared you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Scared this GED thing won't work out and you'll give up on everything else too. Scared that..." She trailed off.

"Scared I'll end up like Danny?"

"Yes."

I set down my pencil. "I'm scared too. Scared I'll fail. Scared I'm not smart enough or strong enough or good enough to actually pull this off. But I have to try, Mom. I have to at least try."

"Why? What changed?"

I thought about Amy's smile. About her hand on mine. About the way she looked at me like I was someone worth knowing.

"I found something worth fighting for," I said.

Mom studied my face, and something in her expression shifted. "The Parker girl?"

Heat crept up my neck. "It's not—I mean, she's my tutor—"

"Marcus." Mom's voice was gentle. "I'm not blind. And I'm not judging. Just... be careful. That's not an easy path you're walking."

"I know."

"Do you?" She leaned forward. "The Parkers are Riverside royalty. You're a Webb from south of the tracks with a record. That girl's mother is going to do everything she can to keep you apart."

"I know," I said again. "But that doesn't change how I feel."

Mom was quiet for a long moment. When she spoke, her voice was soft.

"Then you better make sure you're worth fighting for too."

Monday I showed up at the library with new determination.

If I was going to fight for Amy—fight for the impossible idea that someone like me could be with someone like her—I needed to be someone worth fighting for.

That meant earning my GED.

Proving I could build a future.

Becoming the person Amy already seemed to think I was.

And for the first time in my life, I believed I actually could.

Not because it would be easy.

Not because I was guaranteed to succeed.

But because Amy Parker had looked at me and seen potential, and I'd be damned if I'd prove her wrong.

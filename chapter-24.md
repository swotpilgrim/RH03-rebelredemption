# Chapter 24: Facing It

Monday morning I drove to the library before it opened. Seven-thirty a.m., the parking lot empty except for Mr. Donovan's station wagon.

I had three hours before I was supposed to turn myself in at the police station. Three hours of freedom left.

I wanted to spend at least a few minutes somewhere that had meant something. Somewhere I'd tried to be better.

Mr. Donovan was unlocking the front doors when I pulled up. He turned at the sound of my truck, eyebrows rising when he saw me.

"Marcus. Library doesn't open until nine on Mondays."

"I know." I got out of the truck, hands shoved in my pockets. "I was hoping we could talk. Before—before everything."

Something in my face made his expression shift. He nodded and held the door open.

Inside the library was quiet and dim, just emergency lights until Donovan flipped the switches. The familiar smell of old books and furniture polish hit me, and I felt my throat get tight.

This place had been good to me. Had given me a chance when I didn't deserve one.

And I'd thrown it away.

"My office," Donovan said, leading the way.

I followed him past the front desk, past the reading room where Amy had tutored me every Tuesday and Thursday, past the shelves I'd spent months organizing.

In his office Donovan gestured to a chair. I sat. He settled behind his desk and waited, patient as always.

"I messed up," I said. "Bad."

"Tell me."

So I did. Everything. Snake's threats in the alley, trying to talk to Garrett, the system offering no help. Saturday night at the warehouse, the alarm, getting caught on camera. Having forty-eight hours to turn myself in.

Donovan listened without interrupting, face impassive, hands folded on his desk.

When I finished he was quiet for a long moment.

"You're turning yourself in this morning?" he finally asked.

"Nine a.m. Riverside PD." My voice was rough. "I wanted to come here first. To—to say thank you. For giving me a chance. For treating me like I was worth something."

"You are worth something," Donovan said. "You made terrible choices, Marcus. But that doesn't erase the work you did here. The progress you made."

"Progress." I laughed, bitter. "I'm going to prison, Mr. Donovan. Doesn't feel like progress."

"You're taking responsibility for your actions instead of running. That's progress." He leaned forward. "I've seen a lot of young men come through here on community service. Most of them counting down the hours until they're done, not caring about the work, not trying to change. You were different. You actually tried."

"And look where it got me."

"It got you here. To this moment where you're choosing to face consequences head-on instead of lying or hiding." His voice was firm. "That matters, Marcus. That shows character, even if it doesn't feel like it right now."

I couldn't speak past the lump in my throat.

"Why did you do it?" Donovan asked. "The break-in. You knew what was at stake."

"I was trying to protect someone." I looked down at my hands. "Snake threatened Amy. Said he'd destroy her reputation, her college applications. I thought if I just did this one job he'd leave her alone."

"Did you tell Amy about the threats?"

"Yeah. Eventually. After I'd already made everything worse." I rubbed my face. "She told me to stand up to Snake, to break the cycle. And I—I tried. I talked to Garrett like she said. But when that didn't work I just gave up and did what Snake wanted instead of going back to her for help."

"Why?"

"Because I was scared. Scared of what Snake would do to her. Scared of trusting someone enough to admit I couldn't handle it alone." The words came out raw, honest. "I spent my whole life believing I had to protect everyone by myself. That asking for help was weakness. And look where it got me."

Donovan was quiet, considering. "Did you tell Amy? About Saturday night?"

"Yesterday. I called her and told her everything." My voice dropped. "She hung up on me. Said I made everything worse by not trusting her. She's right."

"Is she?"

I looked up, confused. "What?"

"Is she right that you made it worse?" Donovan's expression was thoughtful. "Or did you make the only choice you could see with the information and fear you had?"

"I made the wrong choice."

"Yes. But wrong choices don't always come from bad intentions." He stood, walked to the window overlooking Main Street. "You were scared. You were trying to protect someone you care about. You made a bad decision, but you weren't being cruel or selfish. You were being young and scared and overwhelmed."

"That doesn't make it okay."

"No," he agreed. "But it makes you human. Not a monster. Not irredeemable." He turned back to face me. "What you did was wrong, Marcus. But who you are—that's still being written."

I wanted to believe him. Wanted to think prison wouldn't define my whole life.

But it was hard to see past the next three hours.

"Amy came looking for you yesterday," Donovan said. "Sunday afternoon. She was worried when you didn't answer her calls Saturday."

"I know. I finally called her Sunday. Told her everything."

"And she was angry."

"Yeah."

"Angry because she cares about you. Because she wanted to help and you shut her out." Donovan came back to his desk. "That kind of anger isn't hate, Marcus. It's hurt. There's a difference."

"Either way, I lost her."

"Maybe. Or maybe she needs time to process. To figure out how she feels about everything." He sat down. "But that's her choice to make. Not yours to decide for her."

The library's front doors opened. Both of us looked toward the sound—too early for patrons.

Footsteps in the main room. Then Amy appeared in the doorway.

She stopped when she saw me, surprise flickering across her face before settling into something guarded and hurt.

"I'm sorry," she said to Donovan. "I didn't know you had someone here. I can come back—"

"It's okay," I said, standing up. "I was just leaving."

"Marcus," Donovan said quietly.

I looked at him.

"Talk to her," he said. Not a suggestion. An order.

I wanted to run. Wanted to avoid the hurt in Amy's eyes, the conversation that would prove she was done with me.

But Mom and Donovan were both right. Amy deserved the truth. Deserved to make her own choices about what my mistakes meant.

Even if those choices broke me.

"Can we talk?" I asked Amy. "Please?"

She hesitated, then nodded. "The study room."

I followed her out of Donovan's office, down the familiar hallway to the back study room where we'd spent so many Tuesday and Thursday afternoons.

Where she'd tried to teach me I was worth saving.

Amy closed the door behind us and crossed her arms, keeping distance between us. "You're turning yourself in today."

"Yeah. Nine a.m."

"And you came here first."

"I wanted to tell Mr. Donovan. To say thank you before—" I stopped. "Before everything."

She was quiet, studying me with an expression I couldn't read. Not angry like yesterday on the phone, but not soft either. Guarded. Hurt.

"I'm sorry," I said. "For all of it. For not trusting you. For making everything worse. For—"

"Why did you really do it?" she interrupted. "And don't say to protect me. I want the truth."

I met her eyes. "Because I was terrified of losing you. Snake said he'd destroy your reputation and all I could think was that I'd finally found someone who saw good in me and I was going to ruin your life just by existing in it." The words tumbled out. "I thought if I did this one job, kept you out of it, you'd be safe from my past. From me."

"So you made the decision alone."

"Yeah."

"Even though I told you I wanted to face it together."

"Yeah."

"Even though I told you I was strong enough to handle hard things."

"I know." My voice broke. "I know you told me all that. But I've spent my whole life believing guys like me poison everything we touch. That we don't deserve good things. And you—you're the best thing that's ever happened to me, Amy. I couldn't stand the thought of being the reason you lost everything you'd worked for."

Tears shone in her eyes but she blinked them back. "And now?"

"Now I've lost you anyway and you're still going to suffer because everyone will know you were tutoring the guy who violated probation." I looked away, unable to face her. "I didn't protect you. I just proved I'm exactly what everyone always thought I was."

The silence stretched between us, heavy and awful.

Then Amy said quietly, "Look at me."

I did.

"You're not what everyone thinks you are," she said. "You're not poison. You're not worthless. You're a scared kid who made bad choices trying to protect someone you care about." She uncrossed her arms, took a step closer. "And I'm angry at you, Marcus. I'm so angry you didn't trust me. That you threw away your future thinking you were saving mine. But I'm not done with you."

I stared at her. "What?"

"I'm not done with you," she repeated. "I'm angry and I'm hurt and I need time to figure out how I feel about all this. But I'm not walking away." Her voice was fierce. "You don't get to decide you're not worth fighting for. That's my choice. And I choose to stand with you, even when you make it really hard."

I couldn't speak. Couldn't process what she was saying.

"I'm coming with you," Amy said. "To the police station. To turn yourself in. You're not doing this alone."

"Amy, you don't have to—"

"I know I don't have to. I want to." She stepped closer, close enough I could see the tears she was fighting back. "You spent weeks trying to protect me by shutting me out. But I'm not letting you shut me out of this. Okay?"

"Okay," I whispered.

She nodded. "Then let's talk to Mr. Donovan. See if there's anything we need to do before nine."

She turned toward the door.

"Amy."

She looked back.

"Thank you," I said. "For not giving up on me. Even though I gave you every reason to."

Her expression softened. "You're welcome. But Marcus? When this is over, when you're out—we're working on your trust issues. Seriously."

Despite everything, I almost smiled. "Deal."

We walked back to Donovan's office together.

And for the first time since Saturday night, I didn't feel completely alone.
